translation of my book about OPA published in South Korea at the end of July 2021.\nI first saw the OPA when designing authorization for micro services for my customer, and I found that OPA is very cool and excellent technology, but it's hard to learn for the early stage because it's something different and weird than general programming languages. So, I searched for a book about OPA but some books illustrate the OPA in a few pages, and it's not sufficient to me. So I started to write a book in the middle of 2020. And finished writing the first draft in March 2021 and published a Korean edition in July 2021.\nBecause OPA is developing so fast, many features such as print function, in keyword(in future.keywords namespace) do not exist when I write. And more and more features will be added very quickly. I realized paper books are limited to quickly reflect the updates of OPA. So I decided to open this book and to keep updating with the OPA community.\nIf you want to contribute/join this project\n\nJoin the OPA Slack(https://slack.openpolicyagent.org/) and discuss your idea in the book channel.\nMake a pull request.\nE-mail your idea to the author.\n\n"},"LICENSE.html":{"url":"LICENSE.html","title":"License","keywords":"","body":"License\n\nThe contents of this book can be used for free and without charge for individual and non-commercial purposes.\nIt is allowed to create pdf and epub formats for non-commercial and personal use purposes and copy them to personal devices such as PCs, tablets, and e-book readers.

In this chapter, we will overview what the OPA is and  explore the use cases of the OPA. And then, related concepts and technologies are examined to promote understanding and prevent confusion.  Finally, basic usage of the OPA is explained for a comfortable start to learn OPA.\nOPA Overview\nOPA is pronounced  as “oh-pa”. At the official homepage of OPA(www.openpolicyagent.org), OPA is introduced as a “general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across”. OPA can be used as a policy engine which includes authorization engine and many people use OPA as authorization engine, but OPA is not limited in authorization engine. OPA fits perfectly for many building blocks of cloud native application architecture(Kubernetes itself, API/GW, service mesh, CI/CD) and services in micro service architecture.\nOPA is developed and maintained by Styra, is open-source and currently managed by CNCF(Cloud Native Computing Foundation) under Linux Foundation. CNCF promoted OPA as graduate status in Feb 2021. A few of them are introduced in this book.Styra maintains OPA and many projects consist of the core ecosystem of OPA as complete open source, and there’s no enterprise version of OPA. For more lists, see awesome opa projects list(https://github.com/anderseknert/awesome-opa) maintained by Anders Eknert. \nOPA is a policy engine designed for cloud native and micro-service environments. Existing permissions and policy systems are based on a centralized database, predefined model and inflexible APIs. OPA, on the other hand, allows to freely define inputs with JSON and easily correspond to rapid changes in model and API using the Policy as Code concept. It also provides a means to distribute policies and data to multiple services, or to easily configure separate authority and policy services. \nThe decision-making process for policies in OPA is shown in Figure 1-1.\n\nFigure 1-1. Decision-making process of OPA 1\n\n1. Source:  https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest ↩\n\nWhen a request or event is delivered to a service, only the values required for policy judgment in that request/event are generated as JSON and passed to OPA as a query. OPA executes a policy written in a dedicated policy language called Rego using the JSON input and returns the value of the evaluation results in JSON format. For example, handing over the current user session's ID, role, and behavior to OPA in the form of JSON allows the user to determine whether it is allowed to do so. In addition to true and false, more complex data can also be returned, resulting in customization-specific settings or detailed permission information.\nCharacteristics of OPA\nIn this section. We will explore the characteristics of OPA. Based on the author's experience, the characteristics described in this section reveal that the subject matter.\nPros of OPA\nThe following features can be seen as pros of OPA.\nIntegrating policy as a code\nProfessional security solutions, such as Enterprise Access Management (EAM), allow for systematic policy management, but require policies to align with the model provided by EAM and include parts that cannot be modeled in the application in separate code. On the other hand, OPA writes a policy as code with complete separation of application code and policy areas, allowing it to integrate all relevant parts of the policy.\nFor example, suppose a particular service provides some services of paid service subscribers to free users on a trial basis as a special event. These issues can be seen as a matter of permission or policy for users to use resources. Event targets, benefits, and duration will continue to vary, and it is difficult to model all of these in advance, and business conditions continue to change. If these are modeled as privileges in professional security solutions, the data models are increasingly complex and difficult to manage, so inevitably some of them will only be handled with application logic. Implementing this as an OPA allows each policy to be modularized and integrated into policy code, offloading policy decisions to handle all changes as independently as possible from the application. In this case, if the input/output data structure of the policy judgment is not changed, no other application parts need to be modified at all.\nFlexibility of input/output format\nOPA input and output formats have high degrees of freedom because they can be expressed in JSON or YAML. Therefore, input/output can be freely defined without having to format the input/output to a predefined API. While too flexible a format can make it difficult to find errors in inputs and outputs, OPA can verify the accuracy of inputs and outputs through test cases, thus complementing these problems.\nProvides REPL and playground\nBecause OPA supports REPL, it is easy to create and test simple policies, and you can load existing policies and data into REPL to see how policy decisions go through. In addition, REPL allows users to make various changes to the input and see how the results change depending on the input, and to add rules to define policies temporarily for the testing purpose.\nOPA supports a playground service that allows OPA to be tested without the need for tool installation, so simple policies can be easily tested by accessing the playground even if the OPA binary is not installed. The URL of OPA playground is https://play.openpolicyagent.org.\nEase of testing and performance measurement\nUnittest can be easily executed if only policy files and data written in Rego are loaded into the OPA engine without writing application code. Test code can be written in Rego the same as the policy file, and code coverage as well as unit testing can be easily calculated.\nIn general, when policies and privileges of an operating service need to be urgently modified, it is quite difficult to test whether the new modifications do not cause adverse effects on other parts of the application if the policy judgment code and existing application code are coupled too closely. OPA significantly reduces this burden because it allows us to develop and test purely logic and data for policies separately from application code.\nAnd the profiling capabilities built into OPA make it easy to see how long it takes to implement policies. Simply adding options when performing a unit test tells you the execution time for each test case, so you can review whether the policy processing performance is sufficient to meet the requirements, and immediately see if the modified logic improves enough.\nPolicy Bundle Support\nOPA provides the ability to package policy files in bundles and serve them remotely. As policies evolve, the number of policy files or data files may increase, and distributing them individually poses difficulties in management. OPA provides bundle management tools to collect these files and organize them into a single bundle. \nConfiguring the OPA client to download policy bundles on a regular basis can constantly reflect policies. Also, because version information can be included when generating bundles, policies can only be updated if the version of the policy has changed.\nApply to many projects\nOPA has been fully validated since 2017 with applications to many projects. OPA is widely applied to the management of rights such as Kubernetes, Istio, various API/GW, AWS and GCP. It is also applied in various places where efficient policy management is required, among security solutions or management tools in cloud environments. In the author's personal opinion, it is currently widely applied to the cloud management stack, but it is expected to be more widely used in the future because it is comparable to the rights management of application services and has a structure suitable for cloud-native applications.\nRapid development speed\nAs of January 2021, the current version of OPA is  0.25.2. OPA is a project that has been under development for more than four years, and its functionality continues to improve and add.\nScope of documentation\nThe contents required for actual implementation are widely documented. Concepts, Rego languages and APIs, and use cases are described in detail, providing various examples.\nCons of OPA\nThe following features can be seen as cons of OPA.\nUnfamiliarity with the policy language Rego\nThe Rego language is unfamiliar and relatively difficult to adapt at first because it is different from the usual programming language or SQL. For example, if and for statements used in common programming languages are not provided, and there are many differences from widely used programming languages, such as the fact that syntax can be executed simultaneously rather than sequentially within rules.\nLimited programming language support\nOPA client libraries are only provided in the Go language. If you do not use a Go language, it can be accessed via the REST server, so OPA is not unavailable for development in other languages. In addition, the ability to compile OPA policies into a web assembly is still being developed to enable the use of OPA policies in various languages, but it is still in development. Also, using a REST server creates a burden of operating and managing separate servers. Operating a policy engine as a single individual service is not a big problem in a micro service environment, but it is often useful to integrate OPA into a library in some circumstances. The reason why OPA is currently applied to cloud/container management stacks, which are mainly implemented in the Go language, is also relevant.\nLack of support of external storage such as DBMS\nSupport for external storage is not implemented by default, so it should be implemented as a development if necessary. Policies are often managed as files, but they are often stored in databases, which require implementation.\nDetail of Documentation\nAlthough the official document covers a wide range of content, some items lack the detail of documentation. In particular, the explanation of the grammar of the Rego language or the code is rather difficult. In order to implement it in practice, it is often necessary to find and refer to related blogs or source codes.\nOPA use cases\nA single sentence definition of OPA is a policy engine that defines rules for policies and determines the outcome of applying rules in current inputs and circumstances. Considering what situations these policy engines will be useful in, we can predict what situations OPA is suitable for. In addition, experienced readers of authority or policy will be able to compare OPA and related technologies in the following sections to understand specifically what situations OPA should be applied to. This section describes the various use cases of OPA..\nUser Authorization\nA typical policy that applies to almost all systems among the various policies is the management of user privileges. Rights management, which manages what permissions a user has and what permissions a system can perform, is the most important and basic policy. It is a scenario in which OPA takes over the user's authority, desired behavior, etc. and determines acceptance/denial according to defined rules. Because the rules for judgment are fully administered by OPA, other parts of the system can delegate the authority check to the rights management system implemented by OPA.\nManaging system policies and constraints\nOPA can be utilized to pre-check whether system change requests violate the system's policies or violate restrictions. OPA rules can be implemented to pre-check whether container creation requests are using bandwidth beyond the allowed IP bandwidth, using CPU or memory in excess of the allowed quota, or creating volumes with supported volume types on the system.\nIn general, OPA rules are written to return true/false, but can return various types of objects, numbers, strings, arrays, etc. So, policies can be implemented as OPA rules to determine the appropriate amount of memory available to the system, priorities.\nAn example of system constraint management is OPA gatekeepers. OPA gatekeepers provide the ability to intercept API calls from Kubernetes to check if changes violate pre-written OPA policies. It is also widely used in terms of authority management as it can compensate for the lack of basic RBAC functionality of Kubernetes. Many of the current use cases of OPA would be Kubernetes policy management through OPA gatekeepers. The relevant information is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.\nAPI gateway security\nTo secure API, OPA can also be applied to apply security policies to API gateways. API gateways such as Gluu, Kong, Traefik, and Tyk have been using official blogs to guide the application of OPA for API authorization.\nInspection tools for CI/CD pipeline\nOPA provides a tool called confest that allows you to examine Tekton, Terraform, and Kubernetes settings in the CI/CD pipeline. Other tools can also be fully applied because formatting to JSON/YAML and adding policies can be used as input to OPA.\nMany examples of applying OPA to CI/CD pipelines can be found in conjunction with AWS Cloud Development Toolkit (CDK), Terraform, Jenkins, and others.\nService Level Policy Management\nOPA can also be applied when implementing policies required for user services, in addition to managing privileges of user accounts and policy management at the system constraint level. Differentiation based on user service policies, events, and rate plans can also be implemented through policies. OPA rules can run unit tests independently of other parts of the program, making them safer to change, and responding more quickly than changing the data schema.\nIntegrated management of policies\nThe best thing about OPA is that it can aggregate the above various use cases to construct subsystems that can specialize only in policies independently of other parts of the entire system. Because cloud native applications integrate everything from infrastructure to user interface into one application through the API, it is a great advantage that all necessary policies can be managed as OPA in these various components.\nRelated concepts and technologies\nBefore we take a closer look at OPA, let's summarize the technologies and concepts associated with authority and policy.\nAuthentication\nAuthentication is a procedure to verify the identity of a user of the system. It is usually the process of logging into a system using an account and password to determine who the user is. It can be seen as similar to the procedure of presenting one's id card in order to confirm one's identity in daily life.\nIf you simply manage system administrator accounts and permissions at the configuration file level, such as the basic implementation of Apache Tomcat, implementing account authentication for user authentication as OPA is not difficult. However, authentication of enterprise services or Internet services with many users is better handled by external systems such as LDAP, Active Directory, and social login, and OPA is more appropriate to pass the authentication results of external systems to check permissions or policies.\nAuthorization\nAuthorization is a procedure to determine what actions the system has permission to perform, unlike authentication. The system needs to be given different privileges for different users for various reasons, such as separating the role of administrators and general users, or depending on the difference in membership level.\nAuthorization or authorization can be seen as a type of system policy and is suitable for implementation as an OPA. For example, administrators can check system-wide failure reports but do not have permission to send mail directly to users, customer representatives cannot verify their cell phone numbers or mail addresses, but can send mail or SMS to users through the system, which is a system policy.\nAudit\nAudit records are recorded in the form of logs to verify the appropriateness of the user's behavior by leaving a history of the actions performed by the user in the system. Apart from whether it is appropriate to implement the authentication and authorization part as an OPA policy, it can be intuitively implemented using OPA, but it is appropriate to leave the audit as a log file or DB record. Therefore, let us note that audit records are not normally implemented as OPA policies.\nAlthough OPA does not directly leave audit records, it is also possible to invoke the REST API within the OPA policy, so violations can be persisted by invoking the API of the audit system in the process of policy evaluation. It also provides the ability for OPA to return violations such as unauthorized system access and user resource quota overruns to the policy's inspection results value in the policy evaluation process, and OPA provides a decision log to leave the evaluation results in the log. It would be more common for audit systems to take over and record such test results information. The first described method is to invoke an external API within a policy, and the second described method is to communicate the OPA policy judgment results to the audit system on code.\nRBAC\nRBAC(Role-based access control) is a method that grants roles to each user and controls access according to the roles granted, and is most widely used in system access control. For example, users of a system are divided into administrator, operator, user, etc. roles, and different permissions are granted for each role. For complex implementations, users can have multiple roles simultaneously, or they can gather different roles to define role groups and provide hierarchical role models.\nIt is common for user role information to be stored as a database, but if the number of users is small, it is possible to define it as a JSON data file and distribute it with an OPA policy. If there are many users, it can be implemented by updating only the changed permission part of the database with policy data from the OPA engine. Access logic based on roles is defined as code by utilizing OPA, which allows flexibility in responding to changes in service rather than applying static RBAC systems, and makes it easier to apply Agile methodology to policy development.\nABAC\nUsers can have a variety of attributes in addition to their roles, and their actions can also have a variety of attributes. ABAC(Attribute Based Access Control) is a method of performing access control by comparing these attributes together under conditions. RBAC systems alone cannot filter all inappropriate behaviors of users, and many of these parts need to be implemented in the application logic. If more of this logic is implemented in code, management and maintenance become difficult. Applying ABAC allows a significant portion of these logics to be implemented as ABAC, which reduces the part to be implemented in code and makes it easier to manage.\nAlthough OPA does not provide all the functions of a general-purpose programming language, it provides sufficient grammar and built-in functions to code ABAC-level policies, so ABAC can be implemented as OPA.\nJWT\nJWT (JSON Web Token) is an industry standard defined by the IETF as RFC 7519, which implements a token signed by encoding information such as user id, issuance time, and privileges granted in JSON. Figure 1-2 shows jwt.io's JWT debugger, which provides a lot of information about JWT. This debugger makes it easy to learn how JWT is signed and validated.\n\nFigure 1-2. JWT debugger provided by jwt.io 2\n\n2. Source: https://jwt.io  ↩\n\nIn addition to standard fields defined by default, user-defined fields can be added to JWT. However, sensitive privacy, etc. should not be included in the JWT and should be utilized for session information delivery purposes that do not require state maintenance as intended.\nSince the JWT itself is not encrypted by default, direct forwarding to user browsers is generally inappropriate, and is primarily used for the purpose of forwarding session information between back-end services. It is also important to secure communication channels by applying HTTPS or TLS when sending and receiving JWT.\nOPA provides features related to signature and signature verification of JWT tokens by default as built-in functions. When issuing a JWT token, the user's role or scope of authority required for policy evaluation is added to the token, which can be used as an input for policy evaluation in OPA by using it with information such as the token validity period provided by JWT.\nOAuth 2.0\nOAuth is a protocol for delegating authorization. Currently, only 2.0 versions are mostly used. OAuth 1.x works by signing API parameters so that they are not tampered with and is not compatible with OAuth 2.0.\nOAuth 2.0 is used by platform providers such as Facebook, Google, Naver, and Kakao to grant platform API access to external third-party services.\nFor example, suppose there is a social game where you can connect to a Facebook account and invite friends and cooperate. If so, you should give the game the authority to list your Facebook friends so that they can be invited to thel games. But you'll have to control your access to privately private photos other than your friends list. OAuth 2.0 allows us to issue access tokens with limited scope and validity to restrict the rights of third parties.\nOAuth 2.0 supports a variety of scenarios for contextual applications and is designed to facilitate implementation of other protocols based on OAuth 2.0. The issuance of access tokens with a simple account/password or authentication using QR code can also be implemented in different scenarios of OAuth 2.0.\nThe caveat of applying OAuth 2.0 is that it must be applied with HTTPS, and because the application targets and security levels are all different for each scenario, it must be accurately identified and implemented.\nThe architectural feature of OAuth 2.0 is that there is a separate service to issue tokens, and the verification of tokens provides high performance scalability by separating the role of the service to provide resources. Information about issued tokens is shared between the token issuing server (i.e., the authorization server) and the resource server that checks the token through memory cache.\nIf OPA is applied to OAuth 2.0, it can be used to check the information in the token from the resource server. OAuth 2.0's access token is a bearer token whose ownership itself means permission and does not identify the user, and in principle, the contents of the token are meaningless.\nHowever, in most OAuth implementations, access tokens are often encrypted JWT tokens, so it is also possible to decrypt and process information from JWT inside OPA. OPA can be utilized as a method of applying OPA to perform policy evaluation based on the attributes of access tokens on the server side that provides resources.\nOpenID Connect 1.0\nOpenID Connect 1.0 is a protocol that was re-developed based on OAuth 2.0 to allow the previously existing OpenID protocol to be applied to HTTP, and is not compatible with OpenID. It is used to implement social login functions such as logging in with Google and logging in with Naver.\nWhile the standard OAuth 2.0 protocol only issues access tokens for API access, it issues ID tokens with access tokens, and the ID token simply includes information such as the user's name.\nFor example, when a particular service asks a Google OIDC server to log in with an account called opa@gmail.com, it goes to the Google login screen, tells the user which service requested to log in, and receives an account and password. Once the account is authenticated, basic information such as account, name, and gender is delivered to the service that requested login, and the service that requested login can confirm that the account exists in Google.\nSocial login functions eliminate the need for services to directly manage passwords or personal information, which can reduce the burden of security.\nOpenID Connect's access tokens and ID tokens are generally JSON processable, so OPA can be applied to OpenID Connect.\nLet’s try OPA\nBefore installing OPA, try using OPA through OPA Playground. OPA Playground is available at https://play.openpolicyagent.org. If the OPA playground does not work well in a browser, it may be a browser compatibility issue, so use Chrome to access the OPA playground.\n\nFigure 1-3. OPA plaground\nWhen accessing the OPA Playground, the Hello World example is loaded by default, as shown in Figure 1-3. Let's follow the example's notes. When the Evaluate button is clicked, the Output window displays the results as shown in Figure 1-4.\n\nFigure 1-4. Running Hello, World in the OPA playground\nLet's take a look at the example first. If you look at the example Hello, World except annotations, the Rego script that declared the policy is as follows.\n\nchap1/hello.rego\n\npackage play\n\ndefault hello = false\n\nhello {\n    m := input.message\n    m == “world”\n}\n\n\n\nIn short, a package called play is declared, defines hello and its default value is false, and the rule that determines hello is whether the value read from the message field of the input object matches \"world\".\nInitial input is {\"message\": \"world\"}. Therefore, the execution result was {\"hello\":\"true\". Let's change the message value in the Input section to something else, such as \"world!!!\" and then click the Evaluate button again. This would change the resulting value to false, as shown in Figure 1-5.\n\nFigure 1-5. Results of execution according to input.message value change.\nNext, change default hello = false to default hello = 1. Contrary to expectations, if input.message is \"world\", true comes out, and if not \"world\", 1 comes out. There will be some confusion. If hello is specified as 1, isn't hello specified as an integer in a typical programming language? If you return the boolean value as a result, you may think that if it is a static type language, an error occurs, and if it is a dynamic type language, the value 1 should be rewritten as false.\nThe policy code's m:= input.message line is the same as the one that initializes the value by declaring a variable in the Go language, and the m==\"world\" line is the same as the one that compares strings in several programming languages, including the Go language, but hello's behavior is similar to that of functions or procedures. The details will be covered in a later chapter, so let's just understand this for now.\nBefore we finish this section, let's take a closer look at the useful features of the OPA Playground. After checking Coverage, click Evaluate to display the code coverage as shown in Figure 1-6.\n\nFigure 1-6. Code coverage of OPA playground\nClick on Examples to see a variety of other examples besides Hello World, as shown in Figure 1-7.\n\nFigure 1-7. Examples provided in the OPA playground\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we looked at the overview and features of OPA and ran simple Hello, World examples through the OPA playground. And briefly discussed the difference between the programming language commonly used by OPA and the concepts and techniques frequently mentioned in relation to OPA. And the powerful features offered by OPA could be experienced indirectly through the playground.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to encourage the reader's curiosity and attention through this. The following chapters discuss how to install and use OPA and related tools.\n"},"chap2/installandusage.html":{"url":"chap2/installandusage.html","title":"Chap 2. OPA Installation and Usage","keywords":"","body":"Chap 2. OPA Installation and Usage\n\n\n\nContents\nInstallation of OPA\nLinux\nMac OS\nWindows\nTest Installation\n\n\nInstall of Visual Studio Code and OPA Plug-in\nInstall of vscode-opa plugin\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nContents\n\nInstallation of OPA\nInstallation of VScode OPA Plugin\nUsage of VScode OPA Plugin\n\nThis chapter describes the basic installation and usage of OPA and related tools so that you can conveniently run the examples covered in subsequent chapters. OPA provides plug-ins for the most widely used editor Visual Studio Code (VSCode) by recent developers, as well as how to leverage the capabilities offered by OPA through the VSCode plug-in.\nInstallation of OPA\nBecause OPA consists of a single binary like any other program written in Go, installation simply requires downloading the appropriate binary for the platform.OPA binaries can act as a REPL, an unittest runner, a code coverage tool, a REST server and etc, depending on arguments. Unless embedding OPA as a client library, the OPA binary can take full advantage of all features. Let's take a look at installing and using the client library later and first take a quick look at how to install and use the OPA binary.\nOPA installation methods can be found in the OPA documentation( https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#running-opa). Referring to the document, let's install it as follows.\nOPA binaries work equally well in Windows, Linux, and Mac OS environments. However, for Windows environments, using shells such as Git Bash can cause problems with the cursor not being displayed when using REPL.\n\nLinux\nDownload the binary with the following curl command and save it under the name opa.\n$ curl -L -o opa https://openpolicyagent.org/downloads/latest/opa_linux_amd64\n\nAfter downloading the file, execute the chmod command to grant permission.\n$ chmod 755 opa\n\nIf you are a bash user, add the following to the .bashrc file to add the OPA binary location to the PATH env variable.\nexport PATH=>\n\nThe above line can be added using editors such as vi, and if you want to add it using a command, run the command as follows in the shell if there is an opa binary in the directory /opt/opa.\n$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/opa' >> ~/.bashrc\n\nTo immediately reflect environment variables without refreshing the shell or restarting Linux, run the following command:\n$ source ~/.bashrc\n\nMac OS\nYou can download it with the curl command, just like the Linux environment, but the url is different.\n$ curl -L -o opa https://openpolicyagent.org/downloads/latest/opa_darwin_amd64\n\nAfter downloading the file, run chmod 755 opa to grant permission.\n$ chmod 755 opa\n\nOn Mac OS, setting the PATH environment variable is essentially the same as Linux. Previous versions of Catalina use bash, but from Catalina they use zsh. If the shell prompt appears as $, bash, and if % appears, zsh. The two shells have different file locations for loading environment variables. If zsh, in the home directory.You can modify the .zsh file instead of the .bashrc file.\nTo modify and reload environment variables, do the following:\n% echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/opa' >> ~/.zsh\n% source ~/.zsh\n\nOPA could also be installed using homebrew. Just do the following:\n%  brew install opa\n\nWindows\nIn windows, download https://openpolicyagent.org/downloads/latest/opa_windows_amd64.exe, rename it opa.exe, and save it.\nThe process of registering environment variables on Windows is complex and varies slightly from version to version of Windows. In this book, versions prior to Windows 10 have been discontinued from official support, and are described as Windows 10 criteria. First, when you open the Control Panel and type \"Advanced System Settings\" in the Control Panel search window, as shown in Figure 2-1, the \"View Advanced System Settings\" menu appears, and when clicked, the Advanced tab in the System Properties dialog box is displayed as shown in Figure 2-2.\n\nFigure 2-1. Advanced System Settings in Control Panel\n\nFigure 2-2. System Properties Dialog Box\nWhen you click the Environment Variables... button, the Environment Variables dialog box is displayed as shown in Figure 2-3.\n\nFigure 2-3. Environment Variables Dialog Box\nBy clicking the Path entry in the[User variable (U) for User]  section, the Path environment variable can be modified as shown in Figure 2-4. Adds a directory path to which opa is installed to the list. Figure 2-4 adds a \"C:\\opbook\" path.\n\nFigure 2-4. Edit Environment Variables Dialog Box\nAfter adding an environment variable, click OK and Apply to reflect the environment variable, and exit and restart the shell or editor to apply the environment variable.\nTest Installation\nLet's run the OPA installation to see if it works properly.  Move to the directory where opa is installed.  Run ./opa in Linux and Mac OS, and simply run opa in Windows. If you have registered PATH environment variables, you can run them directly with opa. If installed normally, the following results can be seen.\n$ ./opa\nAn open source project to policy-enable your service.\n\nUsage:\nopa [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\nbench Benchmark a Rego query\nbuild Build an OPA bundle\ncheck Check Rego source files\ndeps Analyze Rego query dependencies\neval Evaluate a Rego query\nfmt Format Rego source files\nhelp Help about any command\nparse Parse Rego source file\nrun Start OPA in interactive or server mode\nsign Generate an OPA bundle signature\ntest Execute Rego test cases\nversion Print the version of OPA\n\nFlags:\n-h, --help help for opa\n\nUse \"opa [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n\nInstall of Visual Studio Code and OPA Plug-in\nInstall of Visual Studio Code \nBy accessing https://code.visualstudio.com/, you can view the screen shown in Figure 2-5, and download and install Visual Studio Code. After accessing the homepage, click the Download button to install it. The Visual Studio Code is briefly referred to as the VSCode in later parts.\n\nFigure 2-5. https://code.visualstudio.com/\nThe most convenient way to run VSCode is to go from the shell to the parent project directory containing the source with the cd command, run the command code. or run the code  command.\nIf you have run VSCode outside the project directory, simply run File -> Open Directory to open the top directory of the project.\nInstall of vscode-opa plugin\nLet's install the OPA vscode-opa plugin in VSCode. Click the Extensions icon as shown in Figure 2-6, or enter Ctrl + Shift + x (in Mac OS, [Cmd + Shift + x] to open the extension page. The Open Policy Agent can then be entered into the search bar to see the screen shown in Figure 2-6. Let's check if it's a plug-in from Torin Sandall, the core OPA developer, and click Install to install it.\n\nFigure 2-6. Searching vscode-opa Plugin\nCreate a directory called hello_vscode_opa, navigate to it, run vscode . to open the project. Then the screen appears as shown in Figure 2-7.\n\nFigure 2-7. vscode-opa Plugin\nThis book uses bright themes for the readability of the book. If you want to change the theme, you can run the File -> Preferences -> Color Theme menu.\nBasic usage of vscode-opa\nA rego file is required to create and test OPA policies. Move the mouse over the project directory (HELLO_VSCODE_OPA) and the icons appear, and click the New File icon as shown in Figure 2-8.\n\nFigure 2-8. New File Icon\nWhen the File Name text box is displayed, let's create a rego file by typing hello.rego.\nSelect the View -> Command Palette menu, or enter the shortcut [Ctrl + Shift + P] (in Mac OS, [Cmd + Shift + P]) to call the command window. If you type opa here, you can use the commands provided by vscode-opa as shown in Figure 2-9.\n\nFigure 2-9. OPA command menu\nNext, let's make a real sample code and learn how to use it.\nFirst, enter the following rego code into the just created hello.rego file and save it.\n\nchap2/hello_vscode_opa/hello.rego\n\npackage hello\n\ndefault allow_hello = false\n\ndefault allow_world = false\n\nallow_hello {\n    \"hello\" != \"\"\n}\n\nallow_world {\n    \"world\" != \"world\"\n}\n\n\n\nAfter saving the file, invoke the OPA command menu to execute the OPA Evaluate Package command. The Evaluate Package command executes OPA rules from the same package and shows the results.\nAs shown in Figure 2-10, a window is created under the title output.json, with running time as annotation on the top line, and result values on the bottom as json.\n\nFigure 2-10. OPA Evaluation Results\nThis time, let's not run the entire package, but choose a specific rule and run it.\nDouble-click on the allow_hello rule of line 7 as shown in Figure 2-11 highlights the part related to that rule as shown in Figure 2-8.\n\nFigure 2-11. OPA Rule Selection\nWhen the selection is highlighted, [OPA: Evaluate Selection] is executed through the command menu, the results are shown in Figure 2-12.\n\nFigure 2-12. Result of OPA: Evaluate Selection \nIf you look at the results of the execution, you can see a slight difference from when you run the [OPA: Evaluate Package]. The output.json window is created and the time displayed with the annotation first is the same. However, the results are output from an array of values without keys, unlike when the package was evaluated because only a single rule was evaluated. Pressing the [Alt] key  allows users to select both allow_hello and allow_world rules at the same time, but multiple selections of different rules do not work simultaneously.\nRunning OPA: Trace Selection with the same rule selected produces the tracking results of the evaluation process in the Output portion of Figure 2-13. Tracking results are discussed in detail in later chapters.\n\nFigure 2-13. Results of OPA: Trace Selection\nOPA: Profile Selection command allows performance profiling results to be seen in the Output window, as shown in Figure 2-14. Units are expressed in nanoseconds, but the current rule is too simple to measure to zero.\n\nFigure 2-14. OPA: Results of OPA: Profile Selection\nWhen the OPA: Toogle Evaluation Coverage command is launched, the Policy Evaluation Coverage section is displayed as shown in Figure 2-15. The OPA: Google Workspace Coverage menu also allows you to turn coverage off and on on a workspace-by-workspace basis. Coverage-related features are more useful when it comes to unit testing.\n\nFigure 2-15. Results of OPA: Toogle Evaluation\nLet's run a unit test this time.

The Rego language is a rule-driven language that is optimized for describing policies, and has different characteristics from the general-purpose programming language. We visualize the grammar of the Rego language as a rail diagram and elaborate one by one. Understanding the Rego language will allow us to understand how OPA abstracts policies into code.\nRego Overview\nRego is a dedicated language used by OPA to describe policies. The official website tells us that it is correct to pronounce Rego as ray-go. However, this book, like OPA, continues to mark it as Rego. For more information on Rego, see https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/ for official documents.\nThe official website indicates that Rego is an extension of Datalog, an old Prolog-based data processing language with JSON support. The reason why it differs greatly from general-purpose programming languages such as C/C++ and Java is because it is a prologue-based language. If you look at the explanation on the official website, Rego looks like an extension of the datalog, but if you look at the actual datalog grammar, it is completely different. The Rego side is highly readable to developers who are familiar with the existing general-purpose programming language.\nAlthough there is a large difference between datalog and grammar, there is a fundamental commonality of the language centered on rules. Although the datalog does not need to be learned to easily understand Rego because the datalog themselves are rather difficult for users who are not familiar with them, interested readers may want to learn them when they can afford to.\nFor readers curious about the grammar of the datalog, take a look at the presentation at https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall16/compsci516/Lectures/Lecture-21-Datalog.pdf\nConsider the relationship between OPA and Rego. Since both input and data from OPA can be freely written in JSON form, only Rego can be given special meaning in OPA. When OPA is defined from a technical perspective, it can be viewed as a toolbar that provides APIs, frameworks, and runtime for making good use of Rego, focusing on policy engines for performing policies written in Rego. OPA waits after loading the data files referenced by the rules and rules defined as the Rego file. Then, upon requesting an evaluation with inputs, OPA evaluates the rules defined in the Rego files and reflects the evaluation results. The results of these assessments can be inquired through the OPA.\nThe Rego language lists the rules for defining policies. These rules themselves can be seen as declarations of rules rather than code that is actively enforced. When the OPA engine evaluates this rule based on its input, the resulting value of the rule is defined. The part described in the Rego language is the logic by which the resulting value of the rule is defined. When compared to the RDBMS concepts, Rego is most similar to a view. In RDBMS, if you create a table and create the join query as a view, the results of querying the view will change if the data in the table used for join changes. Similarly, changing the input value while the rule is loaded and evaluating the rule again will change the value of the rule.\nIn a typical programming language, variables, functions, and controls are the main components, but in Rego, rules are the main components. Functions are only part of the rule, and controls such as if, while/for, break/continue, and goto are not found. It is important to understand that OPA queries the evaluation results after evaluation of the rules according to the input.\nRego Language Grammar Overview\nThe exact grammar of the Rego language can be viewed by accessing the OPA website and clicking on [Core Doc] -> [Policy Reference] -> [Grammers] as follows. The OPA grammar follows the EBNF(Extended Backus Naur Form) format, which is a slightly extended version of the BNF(Backus Naur Form) format, which is widely used to express the grammar of programming languages, and is the same as the ISO standard format (except that sentences end in semicolons in ISO format). The website seems to have omitted the semicolon for aesthetic reasons.\n\nchap3/rego_ebnf_iso.txt\n\nmodule          = package { import } policy\npackage         = \"package\" ref\nimport          = \"import\" package [ \"as\" var ]\npolicy          = { rule }\nrule            = [ \"default\" ] rule-head { rule-body }\nrule-head       = var [ \"(\" rule-args \")\" ] [ \"[\" term \"]\" ] [ ( \":=\" | \"=\" ) term ]\nrule-args       = term { \",\" term }\nrule-body       = [ \"else\" [ \"=\" term ] ] \"{\" query \"}\"\nquery           = literal { ( \";\" | ( [CR] LF ) ) literal }\nliteral         = ( some-decl | expr | \"not\" expr ) { with-modifier }\nwith-modifier   = \"with\" term \"as\" term\nsome-decl       = \"some\" var { \",\" var }\nexpr            = term | expr-call | expr-infix\nexpr-call       = var [ \".\" var ] \"(\" [ term { \",\" term } ] \")\"\nexpr-infix      = [ term \"=\" ] term infix-operator term\nterm            = ref | var | scalar | array | object | set | array-compr | object-compr | set-compr\narray-compr     = \"[\" term \"|\" rule-body \"]\"\nset-compr       = \"{\" term \"|\" rule-body \"}\"\nobject-compr    = \"{\" object-item \"|\" rule-body \"}\"\ninfix-operator  = bool-operator | arith-operator | bin-operator\nbool-operator   = \"==\" | \"!=\" | \"\" | \">=\" | \"\n\n\nOPA grammar expressed in EBNF(ISO format) 3\n3 Source: https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#grammar\nYou don't have to understand the whole grammar now, and a glance at the whole framework is enough for now. Let's not feel too burdened now because later in chapter 3 we will explain each part with the grammar.\nHowever, it is not possible and inefficient to express everything in a programming language with only syntax, so there is a semantic part that does not appear in grammar. For example, in arithmetic operations, it is usually not grammatically shown that dividing by zero is inappropriate. A more precise declaration of grammar can be defined as nonzero and can be expressed as EBNF, but all of these can be semantically examined in execution rather than grammatically, preventing problems where grammar becomes too complex and syntax interpretation takes too long. Conversely, if we define grammar too simply and focus on semantic aspects, it will be difficult to properly inform users of the language's expressive power.\nRailroad Diagram\nIt is not easy to understand the EBNF grammar of OPA itself, so let's convert it to a more comprehensible form. Railroad diagrams are widely used as a way to make EBNF easier to understand. Many readers will be familiar with the Railroad diagram because it is used a lot when schematizing regular expressions. In this book, the https://bottlecaps.de/rr/ui website was converted to a Railroad diagram. However, the https://bottlecaps.de/rr/ui site was converted to the W3C format as follows, as EBNF on the OPA's official website uses the W3C format differently from the ISO format.\n\nchap3/rego_ebnf_w3c.txt\n\nmodule          ::= package ( import )* policy\npackage         ::= \"package\" ref\nimport          ::= \"import\" package ( \"as\" var )?\npolicy          ::= ( rule )*\nrule            ::= ( \"default\" )? rule-head ( rule-body )*\nrule-head       ::= var ( \"(\" rule-args \")\" )?

Please refer to the OPA grammar written in W3C EBNF format as the source code chap3/rego_bnf_w3c.txt.\nTry converting OPA grammar to a rail diagram: https://bottlecaps.de/rr/ui, click the Edit Grammer tab, select the file, click Load, or open it as an editor to copy the contents of the chap3/rego_bnf_w3c.txt file to see the following in Figure 3-1.\n\nFigure 3-1.

It would be easier to understand if you read the latter part of chapter 3 and refer to the diagram together.\nRego Module\nLet's take a closer look at the grammar of the Rego module.\nModule\nThe top unit of Rego is the module. One Rego file can be viewed as one module. The railing diagram of the module shows Figure 3-3.\n\nFigure 3-3. Structure of the Module\nThe railroad diagram shows that the module consists of a package declaration, an import policy for an arbitrary number of modules (which may not exist). Unscramble the contents of Figure 3-3, the module consists of packages and policies, and can have import statements to include the contents of other modules.\nThe modules in OPA are similar to modules in general-purpose languages such as Go, but can be seen as policies instead of code, and the policies themselves can be viewed as code, so it is almost identical to modules in general-purpose languages.\nPackage\nLet's look at the package declaration this time. A package declaration consists of a keyword package and a name that can be referenced by other modules, as shown in Figure 3-4.\n\nFigure 3-4. Structure of Package Declaration\nA package declaration is similar to a package declaration in a typical programming language, for example:\npackage hello\nIt can also be used to represent a hierarchy using .\npackage hello.test.p1\nDeclared packages are used to isolate different modules when loading the contents of that module, and different package names can have different namespaces, so variables with the same name and functions can exist in different packages.\nImport\nImports are used to import and use modules from other Rego files. Import has the form of import  and is used to include the contents of modules in other packages in the module. In the Rego grammar, the import keyword is represented as followed by a package, as shown in Figure 3-5, but it would be accurate to see a name (reference) that can refer to the package rather than to the package itself.\n\nFigure 3-5. Structure of the Import\nFor example, the following declaration brings up the contents of a module called data.test.example.\nimport data.test.example\nWhen referencing a module within a file, it can only be referenced using the last part of the module's name if the last part does not have the same module. The data.test.example imported from the above example can be referenced as a sample.\nIf you want to use a package imported from within the module under a different name, you can give it a different name using the as statement. It can also be used to facilitate the use of modules with the same last part without a full module reference name. For example, if you import two modules: data.test.example and data.run.example, you can use an as statement to refer to data.test.sample as dtexample, data.run.sample as drexample.\nimport data.test.example as dtexample\nimport data.run.teample as drexample\nImports are primarily used to load modules that store policy data.\nPolicy\nA policy consists of an arbitrary number of rules, as shown in Figure 3-6. In extreme cases, you may not have any rules, but it is not practical to create a module that does not have any rules, so this case is unlikely to be seen. For the purpose of a placeholder that pre-books the package names of parts that users can redefine and use in the future, it seems that there can be a file consisting only of comments without rules.\n\nFigure 3-6. Structure of Policies\nThe OPA official document describes the rule before the module. However, the reason for first describing the module in this book is to emphasize that almost everything is a rule in Rego. When you listen to the explanation of the OPA official document, there are a lot of confusing parts that seem to be rules, but not rules in some areas, and let's first think of these as rules.\nTerm\nBefore we take a closer look at the rules, let's look at the term, a basic element of the Rego language. Terms can be seen as basic data structures representing data in the Rego language. The term consists of a comprehensive set of references, variables, scalar values, arrays, objects, sets, etc., array comprehensions, object comprehensions, and set comprehensions, as shown in Figure 3-7. First, let's look at the basic data structures except for variables and references.\n\nFigure 3-7. Structure of Terms\nScala Value\nRego's scalar value represents a simple value that is not grouped into complex values and can be of string, number, boolean, or null type. Both strings and numbers are identical to the JSON type (i.e., JavaScript type). The structure of scalar values is shown in Figure 3-8.\n\nFigure 3-8. Structure of scalar values\nAn example of allocating scalar values is shown below.\ns : = “hello, world”\nnum := 5\nexists := false\nret := null\nNumber\nSince the number has the same type as the Java script, there is no type distinction between an integer and a floating point, so even if treated as an integer, minimal space is needed to store the exponent. Therefore, let us note that the integer representable range is slightly narrow compared to the typical programming language. Based on 64 bits, the number of integer digits that can be expressed is about three digits smaller.\nString\nThere are two types of strings in Rego, a regular string and a raw string, as shown in Figure 3–9.\n\nFigure 3-9. Structure of the string\nA regular string is a string surrounded by \"\" (double quotes). \\t (tab), \\n (new line), etc. in double quotes are recognized as special characters, such as typical programming languages. For example, if you output the following string, World is displayed on the next line of Hello.\n“Hello\\nWorld”\nA raw string is a string surrounded by a (backtick, located to the left of the number key 1 on the keyboard), as shown in Figure 3-10. Unlike regular  strings, it is displayed as it is except for itself. For example, \\t represents a tab-special character in a normal string, but remains \\ and t characters in the raw string.\n\nFigure 3-10. Structure of the raw string\nFor example, if we output the following string, Hello\\nWorld will be displayed as it is.\n`Hello\\nWorld`\nComposite Value\nA composite value has the form of an object, array, set, etc.\nObject\nFirst of all, objects are easy when you think of JSON objects. The structure of the object is repeated by separating the object entries into , between {}, as shown in Figure 3-11. Object entries are in the form of a : pair, as shown in Figure 3-12.\n\nFigure 3-11. Structure of the objects\n\nFigure 3-12. Structure of object items\nIn Rego's EBNF grammar, at least one pair of : should exist, but in reality there can be {} without any :. \nThe exact grammar of the object is expected to be  object ::= '{' ( object-item ( ',' object-item ) )? '}' in Figure 3-13 rather than object ::= '{' object-item ( ',' object-item ) '}' in Figure 3-11. In addition, {} can be mistaken for representing an empty set, which in Rego is represented as a set(). The name of the type can be found by calling the type_name function described in Chapter 4, which returns \"object\".\n\nFigure 3-13. Accurate  Structure of objects\n> type_name({})\n“object”\n> type_name(set())\n“set”\nAn object consists of keys and values, and it is also possible to include objects or other complex values as its values. The difference is that JSON can use scalar values, references, or variables, unlike using only strings as keys.\nLike JSON, the value of an object can be any other composite value. Thus, it is also possible for objects to be nested in multiple levels with values within the object.\n{\n    “name1”:”value1”,\n    “object”: {“prop1”:”value2”, “prop2”,”value3”}\n}\nIt can also be used as a value for an object by referring to the value assigned by the value assignment as follows. Value assignment will be discussed in more detail in the rules section\nred := “FF0000”\n{“color”:red, “size”:270}\nThe equality between objects can be compared to each other. The following comparisons result in a return of true because the values of the objects are practically the same.\n{“name1”:”value1”, “name2”:”value2”} == { “name2”:”value2”, “name1”,”value1”}\nArray\nArrays are ordered by a set of terms, such as values and references, and can be referenced by an index. An array is represented by elements surrounded by [] and separated by ,.\n\nFigure 3-14. Structure of an array\nIf an array of strings has been assigned under the name numbers as shown below, the entries in the array can be referenced in the form numbers[0], numbers[1].\nnumbers := [“zero”, “one”, “two”, “three”, “four”]\nIf you attempt to refer to a negative number or a value greater than the actual index of the array, an undefined ref error occurs because the reference target is not defined.\nEmpty arrays can also be declared as follows, but Rego's EBNF grammar states that at least one element is needed.\nempty_array := [ ]\nThis appears to be an error in EBNF grammar posted on the OPA website. Also, the correct grammar would be array ::= '[' ( term ( ',' term ) )?  as shown in Figure 3-15, not  array ::= '[' ( term ( ',' term ) )? ']' as shown in Figure 3-14.\n\nFigure 3-15. Accurate structure of an array\nSet\nA set is a complex value consisting only of terms without a key. Unlike arrays, there is no order and only one duplicate value is stored. There are two sets, empty set and non empty set, as shown in Figure 3-16.\n\nFigure 3-16. Structure of the set\nAn empty set is represented by set(), not by {}, as shown in Figure 3-17. Since {} means an empty object without a : pair, we express the empty set as set() to distinguish it from this.\nempty_set := set()\n\nFigure 3-17. Structure of an empty set\n\nFigure 3-18. Structure of a non-empty set\nIf it is not an empty set, the underlying elements are separated by , and surrounded by {}, as shown in Figure 3-18. The following is a collection of frequently used encodings for Korean language.\nencodings := { “euc_kr”, “cp949”, “utf-8” }\nSince there is no order in the set, it is judged that the values being constructed are the same with different orders considered as the same set. Because the set treats duplicated items as one, it becomes true not only when the order is different, but also when:\n> {1,2,3} == {2,2,3,3,1,1,1}\ntrue\nIf you type {2,2,3,3,1,1} in Repl, you can see that it is actually stored as {1,2,3}.\nComprehension\nYou will occasionally encounter comprehension when learning programming languages or mathematics. Rego has three types of comprehension. In mathematics, a comprehension may be easy to understand if you think of such a form of expression as {x | x is an integer greater than 3 } and so on.\nObject Comprehension\nAn object comprehension represents the rule that the  :  that constitutes the object must satisfy. The structure of the object comprehensive expression is shown in Figure 3-19 and has the form of {  :  |  }.\n\nFigure 3-19. Structure of object comprehension\nLet's look at an example of object comprehension. Let's enter the following code in REPL.\n$opa run\nOPA 0.19.2 (commit 40f9c1fe, built at 2020-04-27T22:51:13Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands.\n\n> fruits := [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"pineapple\"]\nRule 'fruits' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n\n> strlength := { st : count(st) | st = fruits[_] }\nRule 'strlength' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n\n> strlength\n{\n    \"apple\": 5,\n    \"banana\": 6,\n    \"pineapple\": 9\n}\nFirst, we created an array called fruits with three items: banana, apple, and pineapple. An object called strlength was then declared as an object comprehension, with the key st and the value count function to return the length of the string. The rule part of the comprehension st = fruits[_] iteratively assigns each element of the fruit array to st as it travels. In the last line, the contents of the object were printed by inputting strlength from the REPL. As a result, it can be seen that an object is created in which an item in the fruit array becomes a key and the string length of the key becomes a value.\nSet Comprehension\nA set comprehension declares a set by expressing the rules that the set must satisfy. The structure of the set comprehension is shown in Figure 3-20 and has the form of {  |  }.\n\nFigure 3-20. Structure of the set comprehension\nLet's look at an example of a collective formula. Let's enter the following code in REPL.\n$opa run\nOPA 0.19.2 (commit 40f9c1fe, built at 2020-04-27T22:51:13Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands.\n\n> fruits := [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"pineapple\"]\nRule 'fruits' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n\n> under7char := { st | st = fruits[_]; count(st)  under7char\n[\n    \"banana\",\n    \"apple\"\n]\nFirst, we declare the same array of fruits that we declared in the object comprehension. Then, in the set comprehension, we declare the items to be included in the set as st, and iteratively substitute them as we traverse the items of fruits in st. Subsequent semicolons are used to distinguish rules and specify a rule that the string length of st is less than 7. When multiple rules are used together in the body of rules, both and conditions must be satisfied. The output of the result under7char then shows a set of missing pineapple with string length greater than 7.\nUnder7char is a set although it is surrounded by []. In an array, \"banana\" should be output when under7char[0] is entered, but an error occurs, and when under7char[\"banana\"] is entered, \"banana\" is outputted.\n> under7char[0]\n1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_type_error: undefined ref: data.repl.under7char[0]\ndata.repl.under7char[0]\n^\nhave: 0\nwant (type): string\n\n> under7char[\"banana\"]\n\"banana\"\n>\nArray Comprehension\nAn array comprehension declares an array by expressing the rules that the array must satisfy. The structure of the array comprehensive expression is shown in Figure 3-21, and has the form of [  |  ].\n\nFigure 3-21. Structure of the array comprehension\nLet's look at an example of an array comprehension. Let's enter the following code in REPL.\n$opa run\nOPA 0.19.2 (commit 40f9c1fe, built at 2020-04-27T22:51:13Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands.\n\n> fruits := [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"pineapple\"]\nRule 'fruits' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n\n> under7char2 := [ st | st = fruits[_]; count(st)  under7char2\n[\n    \"banana\",\n    \"apple\"\n]\nCompared to the set comprehension, we changed {} to [ ] and renamed it under7char2 to under7char2. The rules used to create are identical. Although under7char2 has the same output from REPL, under7char2 is an array generated by array comprehension, whereas under7char is a set generated by set comprehension. Let's enter under7char2[0] in REPL to see the difference. Since under7char2[0] is an array, \"banana\" is printed as expected.\n> under7char2[0]\n\"banana\"\nVariables and References\nVariables and references are also a term in grammar, but they have different properties from those described earlier, so we describe them separately.\nVariables\nThe variables in Rego differ from those in a typical programming language. Rego finds a value for a variable that makes all expressions evaluated as true, and if not found, the variable becomes undefined. Furthermore, variables cannot be changed once assigned. The assignment of values to be examined in the rule section is also described as assignment to variables in part of the official document, but according to OPA REPL’s output message, it makes more sense to view value assignment as a rule. Even if we look at this as a value assignment to a variable, there is no significant problem if we note that the variable does not change once defined.\nBecause OPA aims to make policy evaluation and the evaluation is performed by queries on variables in the data domain, it will be difficult to maintain consistency in the results of policy evaluation if the values of variables continue to change.\nVariables can be used as inputs and outputs. If a variable has a value assigned to it and is used as a parameter, it can be used as an input to pass the value, and if a variable that does not have a value assigned passed as parameter, it can receive an output value from that variable. This is the main factor that confuses Rego, as it can be input or output even if used in the same position. For example, when evaluating a[i] == 3, if you assign a value of 2 to a, you will find that a[2] has a value of 3, and if you evaluate the above value without assigning i, you will collect the indices of those with a value of 3 in the array and assign them to i.\nIn REPL, the input is treated as an assignment to the input variable, which will change the result for the same query, which will lead to questions about whether the value of the variable will change. In this case, if a new policy evaluation is performed by passing new inputs, a new context is created, and the variables in this contact are different from the previous context.\nThe name of the variable has the same format as Figure 3-22. In other words, it starts with an alphabet (including both upper and lower case letters) or an underscore (_) and repeats the underscore, number, and alphabetic characters.\n\nFigure 3-22. Format of variable names\nLet's actually check out the concept of variables. Run opa run to run REPL, then enter the following input line by line.\na := [1,2,3]\na[b] == 1\na[c] == 5\nRunning a: = [1,2,3] assigns an array consisting of 1,2,3 to a.\n> a := [1,2,3]\nRule 'a' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\nNext, enter an expression with a[b] == 1 to find the value of b that can make that expression true. b is used as the index for the array, the first entry is 1 and the index starts at 0.\n> a[b] == 1\n+---+\n| b |\n+---+\n| 0 |\n+---+\nNext, let's enter an expression with a[c] == 5. Since a does not have 5 as an item, no c can be found to satisfy that expression. Thus c becomes undefined as expected.\n> a[c] == 5\nundefined\nNote that variables described in sections [Introduction/Rego/Variables] (https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#variables) and [Policy Language/Variables] (https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#variables) of the OPA Official document are described from different perspectives, which can be confusing. In this book, we tried to interpret the contents of the two parts as much as possible so that the reader could understand them best, but if the description of the relevant part of the official document is rewritten more clearly in the future, the interpretation may change, so we recommend you to check it once more.\nReference\nReferences provide a means of accessing the hierarchical structure when variables, arrays, objects, function call results, etc. have hierarchical structure, as shown in Figure 3-23.\n\nFigure 3-23. Structure of the reference\nThe things that can be the top hierarchies of references are variables, arrays, objects, sets and array comprehension, object comprehension, set comprehension, and function calls, as shown in Figure 3-23. Comprehensions and function calls are not references to the representation itself, but references to arrays, objects, sets, etc. produced as a result of the representation. Once the top-level reference target is determined, the child element can be referenced via a reference argument. In addition, if the referenced child element has a child element again (e.g., an object is specified again for a particular key of the object), it can be accessed again through a reference argument.\nThe reference argument can access the sub-elements of the target through two methods, using . and naming variables between [ ], as shown in Figure 3-24.\n\nFigure 3-24. Structure of the reference argument\nThe approach using . is shown in Figure 3-25. It can then be referenced via a key that satisfies the variable name format.\n\nFigure 3-25. Reference using .\nApproaches using [ ] are referenced using scalar values, variables, arrays, objects, sets, and _ between [ ], as shown in Figure 3-26.\n\nFigure 3-26. Reference using [ ]\nLet's look at an example of a reference. First, the array can be referenced using [], giving an index starting from zero between [].\nfruits := [“apple”, “banana”, “pineapple”]\n\n# “banana”\nfurits[1]\nFor a set, both references using [] and references using . are possible. However, if strings, etc. contain – characters, be aware of references using . are sometimes not possible.\nencoding := {\"utf-8\", \"euc-kr\", \"cp949\"}\n\n# “\"utf-8\"\nencoding[\"utf-8\"]\n\n# “cp949”\nencoding.cp949\n\n# 1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_type_error: minus: invalid argument(s)\nencoding.utf-8\nAn object is similar to a set, but returns a value corresponding to the key.\nbob := {\"name\":\"bob\", \"age\":50, \"point\":1000}\n\n# 50\nbob.age\n\n# 1000\nbob[\"point\"]\nIn addition, hierarchical structures such as including objects again as values within objects can be accessed sequentially through references.\nbob := {\"name\":\"bob\", \"age\":50, \"membership\": {\"point\":1000, \"coupon\":[\"50percentdc\", \"1000wondc\"]} }\n\n# 1000\nbob.membership.point\n\n# \"50percentdc“\nbob.membership[\"coupon\"][0]\n\n# { \"coupon\": [ \"50percentdc\", \"1000wondc\" ], \"point\": 1000 }\nbob[\"membership\"]\n\n# 1000\nbob[\"membership\"][\"point\"]\nIteration\nThe form  of the reference using [ ] can be used for Iteration.\nFor example, in the following example, the fruitindex rule finds \"apple\" in the fruit array and returns the index. Enter the example below in REPL and enter fruitindex to return 0. This is because if a variable that meets the conditions exists while iterating the array, it is stored in the index variable, and if the rule is satisfied, the index is assigned to the rule.\nfruits := [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"pineapple\"]\nfruitindex = index { fruits[index] == \"apple\" }\nHowever, if the index is not needed and only checked for existence, it would not be necessary to store the index in the index variable, but it would still require an iteration. In this case, [_] allows index variables to be traversed without saving them.\nThe following example is a rule that does not locate an index, but only checks its existence. Enter in REPL and enter fruitxists to return true.\nfruits := [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"pineapple\"]\nfruitexists = true { fruits[_] == \"apple\" }\nRule\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the declaration of rules is everything of Rego. Rules vary from rules that assign values directly to them, rules that assign values if the content of the rule body is true, rules that assign part of the rule's evaluation value, and final evaluation values define them as sets or objects, and functions that modularize the rule.\nThe structure of the rules is shown in Figure 3-27. At the beginning of the rule, the default keyword is optionally placed, and a rule head exists. There may be several rule bodies behind the rule head, and no rule body may exist. Rules, such as value assignment and function, are separated by the form of the rule head, which is described in detail by examining by rule form.\n\nFigure 3-27. Structure of the rule\nValue Assignment\nThe most basic rule of the Rego language is assignment of values and has the structure shown in Figure 3-28. Value assignment is similar to constant declaration in other languages. It makes certain values easier to read elsewhere, such as naming 3.14 pi.\nValue assignment is a form of rule in which only rule heads exist without the default keyword and rule body. Value allocation has a syntax of  := . For example, hello := the form \"world\".\n\nFigure 3-28. Structure of the value assignment\nA term that can be a value(right-hand side) of a value assignment can be a scalar value, an array, a set, an object, etc., or a comprehension that simply represents a composite value. In addition, the type of value is not specified separately and is automatically inferred.\nProperties of Value Assignment\nBy default, multiple assignments of the same value result in an error in the rego file. In REPL, on the other hand, re-assigning values overwrites previous values. First, write the following code and save it as badassign.rego.\n\nchap3/badassign.rego\n\npackage data\n\na := 3\nb := 4\n\na := 5\n\n\n\nIf you have saved the code, let's run the following command. opa run is a command that executes REPL, with parameters specifies rego files or JSON data files to load when REPL is run, reads and preloads them during REPL operation. As a result of execution, the part where a:=5 is written prints an error that the rule a has been re-declared.\n$ opa run badassign.rego\nerror: compile error: 1 error occurred: test.rego:3: rego_type_error: rule named a redeclared at test.rego:6\nWhen using a value assignment rule, we notice that it cannot be redeclared with the same name.\nThis time, let's run REPL without a rego file. When the REPL is executed and the > prompt appears, enter a:= 3, b:= 4, a:= 5 sequentially.\n$ opa run\nOPA 0.19.2 (commit 40f9c1fe, built at 2020-04-27T22:51:13Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands.\n\n> a := 3\nRule 'a' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see Rules.\n\n> b := 4\nRule 'b' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see Rules.\n\n> a := 5\nRule 'a' re-defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see Rules.\n\n> show\npackage repl\n\nb := 4\n\na := 5\n>\nUnlike when loading files, the rule a is redefined. If REPL does not allow redefinition, it will not be able to correct mistakes without re-defining them from scratch when entered by mistake. Remember that value allocation rules cannot be reallocated for the same name because in normal situations with OPA, the rego file will be loaded into the REST server or the go client library.\nComplete Rule\nThe aforementioned value assignments only assign values and do not result in policy evaluation. Let's look at the rules by which policy evaluation takes place other than assignment of values. A rule in which a value is set according to the satisfaction of the rule phrases is called the complete rule in OPA, and a rule that allows parts of the rule to be reused using variables is called the partial rule.\nIf you look at OPA-related documents, you will see many of the following types of rules.\n {\n  \n  \n...\n  \n}\nThis form of rule is abbreviated to the following form.\n = true {\n  \n  \n...\n  \n}\nThe regularized form of a rule is as follows, and the above two forms are particularly true when the rule is true.\n =  {\n  \n  \n...\n  \n}\nThe  =  part is the rule head, and the rule literals surrounded by {} are the rule bodies. The rule name is assigned a rule value only when all the syntaxes in the rule body are satisfied with AND, but the order of the rule body literals is irrelevant.\nIf we look at the structure of the complete rules we have looked at so far, it is shown in Figure 3-29.\n\nFigure 3-29. Structure of the complete rule\nA complete rule has a rule body, and the structure of the rule body is shown in Figure 3-30.\n\nFigure 3-30. Structure of the rule bodies\nThe front part of the rule body can have optional else statements, and essentially a single query block surrounded by {}. In addition, the query part is repeated with more than 0 literals, which are separated by semicolon (;) or line-changing open characters (\\n or \\r\\n depending on the platform). In other words, if you want to express multiple  literals in a line, you can separate them into semicolons, and if you divide them into lines, they are recognized as multiple  literals. When expressed in multiple lines and finished with a semicolon, it is the same as adding an empty line, so nothing changes in the code. Therefore, the following three forms are identical in content. Literals are later described with operators.\n{\n  ; ; ...\n}\n{\n  \n  \n...\n}\n{\n  ;\n  ;\n...\n}\nUnlike assignment of values, there can be several rules with the same rule name, which are called Rule Sets, and if any of the rules that make up the rule set are satisfied, they are assigned to that value. A rule set can be incrementally defined by adding a new rule of the same name to an existing rule set. If multiple rules of the same name are declared, only one of them needs to be satisfied, so it can also be seen as an OR relationship. In addition, if the rules in the rule set are complete rules described in this section, the result value of rules cannot be specified differently.\n =  {\n  \n  \n...\n}\n\n =  {\n  \n  \n...\n}\nIf multiple rule bodies are declared in one  =  pair, then the same  =  is the same as each rule body is declared (there should be no else statement to describe later).\n =  {\n  \n  \n...\n} {\n  \n  \n...\n}\nElse Statement\nConnecting multiple rule bodies with an else statement allows you to write a rule to check the conditions on the next body when the conditions on the first body are not satisfied. The grammar of a rule using an else statement can be expressed as follows.\n =  {\n  \n  \n...\n} else =  {\n  \n  \n...\n} else =  {\n  \n  \n...\n}\n...\nUnlike a rule set, if multiple rule bodies are linked by an else statement, the conditions of the first rule body are not satisfied, then the conditions of the next rule body are checked. You can also specify a value to assign to a rule when its body is satisfied in the form else =  for each else statement.\nIf you look at the case where the else statement appears in the previous figure, it is grammatically possible to use only else, not in the form else = . Testing with REPL does not result in an error. If connected only by else, the assignment value is true when each rule body is satisfied, so even with the else statement, it behaves the same as the rule set. In such cases, it can be confusing, so make sure to use the form else =  when using an else statement.\n = {\n  \n  \n...\n} else {\n  \n  \n...\n}\nLet's run REPL and enter the following code. The code declares a rule called elstest, in which elstest is assigned 1 if count(\"apple\") == 3. Then, if the else statement does not satisfy the first time, assign 2 to the rule if the else statement satisfies count(\"apple\") == 5. By entering elstest, the value of that condition can be similarly imitated by an if or switch statement in a general-purpose programming language, especially when creating a function.\n> elstest = 1 { count(\"apple\") == 3 } else = 2 { count(\"apple\") == 5}\n\n> elstest\n2\nDefault Statements\nBy default, when a rule satisfies its literals in the rule body, the value of the rule name is assigned to the specified value. If the rule body is not satisfied, it is undefined, in which case the default value is assigned if the default value is specified. The default statement is used to specify the default value, which is also a form of rule. The default statement does not necessarily have the same value type as other rules with the same name, but it is recommended to use the same type to reduce errors. A default statement has the following form:\ndefault  = \nThe structure of the default statement is shown in Figure 3-31.\n\nFigure 3-31. Structure of default statement\nExamples of Rules\nLet's look at an example of a rule. The allow rule defined in the following has a default value of false. The first rule is that if input has a role value of \"admin\", allow becomes true. The second rule is true if both values are true if the input's roll value is \"user\" and the input's has_permission value is true at the same time.\ndefault allow = false\n\nallow = true {\n    input.role == “admin”\n}\n\nallow = true {\n    input.role == “user”\n    input.has_permission == true\n}\nLet's change the code above from allow = true to allow = 1 as follows. That way, it becomes the following code.\ndefault allow = false\n\nallow = 1 {\n    input.role == “admin”\n}\n\nallow = 1 {\n    input.role == “user”\n    input.has_permission == true\n}\nIf input.role is \"admin\" or input.role is \"user\" and input.has_permission is true at the same time, then allow is evaluated as 1 rather than true. The default is not changed, so if neither rule is satisfied, then allow = false. We can see that the default of the rule and the evaluation value allocated upon successful evaluation do not necessarily have to be of the same type, and that the rule is different from the variables, etc\nIf one of the two rules is changed to allow = 1 and the other is left to allow = true, the following error occurs during the actual evaluation.\neval_conflict_error: complete rules must not produce multiple outputs\nPartial Rule\nA Partial Rule is a rule that assigns values that conform to the rules set in the rule body to a variable as a set or object. Since objects can also be viewed as a set of : pairs depending on the perspective, a partial rule can be seen as a rule to generate sets temporarily. Writing Rego rules often involves multiple steps of assigning a set temporarily and filtering out parts of the set that meet the conditions. Refactoring code to generate new sets by filtering them temporarily into sub-rules enables recycling of partial rules regardless of several other rules (complete rules, partial rules, functions, etc.).\nAfter the rule name in the variable name format, there is a base element surrounded by [], which results in a set of basic elements that make the rule body true.\n\nFigure 3-32. Rule head structure for partial rules that generate sets\nLet's look at an example of a partial rule that generates a set. Let's enter the nonapplefruits into REPL that define a set of the nonapplefruits in the fruit array as follows. Then you can see the expected result.\n> fruits :=[\"apple\",\"banana\", \"pineapple\"]\nRule 'fruits' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n> nonapplefruits[fruit] { fruit := fruits[_]; fruit != \"apple\" }\nRule 'nonapplefruits' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n> nonapplefruits\n[\n    \"banana\",\n    \"pineapple\"\n]\nPartial rules that create objects have rule heads as shown in Figure 3-33. We can see that the =  part is attached to the back of the [ ] part compared to the case of generating a set. The element in [ ] relates to the part of the object's attribute key, and the  after = corresponds to the part of the value for that key.\n\nFigure 3-33. Rule head structure of partial rules that create objects\nLet's look at an example of a rule that creates an object. We defined an object called bob, which has properties such as age, height, and weight. We define bobwithoutage to create a new object that removes the age part of Bob's attribute. If you enter it as it is in REPL, you can see that it works as you expected.\n> bob := { \"age\":30, \"height\":180, \"weight\":100}\nRule 'bob' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n> bobwithoutage[key] = val { val := bob[key]; key != \"age\" }\nRule 'bobwithoutage' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n> bobwithoutage\n{\n    \"height\": 180,\n    \"weight\": 100\n}\nFuction\nA function is also a type of rule, and it has the following form.\n ( , ... ) =  {\n    \n    \n...\n}\nSince the function is also a rule, the structure of the rule body is the same as the other rules, and the structure of the rule head is shown in Figure 3-34. Grammatical features alone suggest that a rule has a list of rule arguments separated by , surrounded by a variable name format function name followed by ( ). A function without any rule factor is also possible, which is also expressed as ( ).\n\nFigure 3-34. Rule head structure of the function\nLet's define a function and use it. In VSCode, enter the following code and save it with the desired name such as function.rego.\n\nchap3/function.rego\n\npackage function\n\nmultiply(a,b) = m {\n    m := a*b\n}\n\nresult1 = r {\n    r := multiply(3,4)\n}\n\nresult2 = r {\n    r := multiply(3,9)\n}\n\n# result3 = r {\n#     r := multiply(4,6,7)\n# }\n\n# result4 = r {\n#     r := multiply(\"23\",5)\n# }\n\n\n\nBriefly explain the code above as follows. First, we declared a package called function. The function is then declared with the name \"multiple\" and returns the value assigned to the variable \"m\" by accepting \"a\" and \"b\" as factors. The text simply returns two arguments a and b multiplied.\nWe then declare two rules, result1, and result2, to verify that the function is functioning properly. result1 calls the multiply function 3 and 4 as arguments and declares that the resulting value is defined as r. result2 is the same as result1, except for changing the arguments to 3 and 9.\nLet's check if the function you wrote works properly. Enter [Ctrl + Shift + P] (Cmd + Shift + P on Mac OS) and select [OPA: Evaluate Package] to evaluate the value. The results are as follows\n// Evaluated package in 999.4µs.\n{\n    \"result1\": 12,\n    \"result2\": 27\n}\nNext, let's look at how a function behaves when the number of arguments is incorrect or when an invalid argument is passed that does not support multiplication. Let's add result3, result4, enter [Ctrl + Shift + P] (Cmd + Shift + P on Mac OS) and select [OPA: Evaluate Package] to evaluate the value.\nresult3 = r {\n    r := multiply(4,6,7)\n}\n\nresult4 = r {\n    r := multiply(\"23\",5)\n}\nWhen trying to perform the evaluation, the following errors occur:\nfunction.rego:16: rego_type_error: data.function.multiply: too many arguments\n\nfunction.rego:20: rego_type_error: data.function.multiply: invalid argument(s)\nAs an argument in a function, you can use values directly as well as variables. Save the following code as function2.rego and evaluate it.\n\nchap3/function2.rego\n\npackage function2\n\none(\"number\") = r {\n    r := 1\n}\n\none(\"string\") = r {\n    r := \"one\"\n}\n\ntestRule = result {\n    result := one(\"number\")    \n}\n\n\n\nThe result will be as follows.\n// Evaluated package in 0µs.\n{\n    \"testrule\": 1\n}\nIf values are directly used as arguments, lookup tables and others can be implemented. However, there is a caveat: if a function is performed with the same name several times, there is no problem if only values exist at the same argument location, but if values and variables are mixed, problems arise. For example, a problem arises when one of the two functions with the same name receives a value and one receives a variable.\nLiterals\nA look at the structure of the literal used to write rules in the rule body is shown in Figure 3-35.\n\nFigure 3-35. Structure of the literals\nliteral can be a \"some\" statement or expression, and expressions can optionally have a \"not\" in front or a \"with\" statement in tail. Grammarly, it seems that a \"some\" door can also be attached to a \"some\" statement, but a \"some\" statement doesn't mean much.\nSome Statement\nSome statements are used to explicitly declare variables that are used locally within the rule body. It is used to clarify that a variable is a local variable, regardless of the existence of an external variable, because if it is not clarified that the statement is a local variable, then an external variable can be referenced if there is a variable with the same name outside the rule. Therefore, it is always recommended to declare a local variable as a \"some\" statement unless it is clearly: = value allocation (the local variable on the left side is declared at the same time as the value allocation).\nThe structure of some statement is shown in Figure 3-36. The \"some\" statement declares a comma-separated list of variable names after the \"some\" keyword. Since variables with that name are declarations of local variables, there is no particular complexity.\n\nFigure 3-36. Structure of some statements\nLet's look at an example of using some statements.\nfind_apple = index {\n    some index\n    fruits[index] == “apple”\n}\nIn the example, the rule find_apple is declared, and if the rule is satisfied, the variable index is returned. Then, if the local variable index is declared and the value \"apple\" is satisfied in an array called fruits, the index is placed in the index variable. In the example above, it works the same even if some index lines are excluded as follows.\nfind_apple = index {\n    fruits[index] == “apple”\n}\nBut what if the index is already defined outside as follows?\nindex := 1000\n\nfind_apple = index {\n    fruits[index] == “apple”\n}\nWhen tested in REPL, the value of find_apple is undefined. Since the index is declared, the evaluation results are false and the rule undefined because the variable index satisfying fruits[index] == \"apple\" is evaluated without finding the variable index satisfying fruits[1000] == \"apple\". Thus, local variables should always be declared \"some\" to prevent them from behaving differently because a variable with the same name exists externally.\nWith Statement\nThe with statement is used in the syntax to override input or data with specific data. The with statement is usually used when writing unit tests, and its structure is shown in Figure 3-37.\n\nFigure 3-37. Structure of with statements\nThe OPA official document warns that if a statement is used with data, it should not be used with subparts of data created as virtual documents by partial rules.\nExamples of use of statements are as follows.\ninput.role == “admin” == with input as { ”role“:”admin“, ”id“: ”1133“ }\nThe with statement will be examined in more detail when writing test codes in later chapters.\nExpression\nThe structure of the expression is shown in Figure 3-38. An expression can be a term, a function call, or an expression containing an infix operator.\n\nFigure 3-38. Structure of the expression\nLet's look at the expression for function call, since we've already looked at the term earlier. The structure of the expression for function  is shown in Figure 3-39. As expected, it is in the form of a function name (an argument of the term, ...). \n\nFigure 3-39. Structure of the expression of function call\nIn grammar, a function name is represented as such that only one . can be added between the variable name formats, which in fact appear to be an error in grammar as a function name separated by several .. The OPA official document also recommends distinguishing names from functions in other modules, such as org.example.special_func, to avoid name conflicts when defining functions to be used by other modules.\nAn example of a function call is as follows:\ncontains(fruits, “banana”)\nglob.match(\"*:github:com\", [\":\"], \"api:github:com\")\norg.example.special_func()\nNot Statement\nA not statement is a statement that negates the result of an expression. If the expression compared with the == operator is negated, it is equivalent to the comparison with the != operator. Therefore, the following two expressions are identical:\nnot \"hello\" == \"world“\n“hello” != “world”\nFor another example, define a rule that corresponds to the negation of a particular rule. Suppose there is a rule to check whether the following fruit array contains \"apple\".\ndefault appleinfruits == false\nfruits := [\"apple\",\"banana\", \"pineapple\"]\nappleinfruits { fruit = fruits[_]; fruit == \"apple\" }\nSo how can we define a rule that checks if \"apple\" is not in the fruits array? Let's define it using the not statement. At first glance, it looks like we can do it like this.\ndefault wrongapplenotinfruits == false\nfruits := [\"apple\",\"banana\", \"pineapple\"]\nwrongapplenotinfruits { fruit = fruits[_]; not fruit == \"apple\" }\nHowever, if you type in REPL, \"apple\" exists in the fruit array, so it is expected to be false, but it is true. If you look closely at this rule, we put fruits in the fruit variable as we traverse them, and continue to compare \"apple\" with the fruit variable. The rule body has become true because there are cases in the iteration that satisfy not fruit == \"apple\" in the rule body. In other words, the use of not statements on the iteration may behave differently than expected, so caution is needed.\nInvoking another rule with a not statement on the rule body, such as the following, yields the intended result.\ndefault applenotinfruits == false\napplenotinfruits { not appleinfruits }\nExpression with Infix Operator\nThe expression with infix operator is in the form of  =   or    and its structure is shown in Figure 3-40.\n\nFigure 3-40. Structure of the infix operator expression\nIn Rego, there exists three infix operators: comparison operators, arithmetic operators, and set operators, as shown in Figure 3-41. A bin-operator may seem like an operator for logic, but it is actually an operator for a set.\n\nFigure 3-41. Structure of the infix operator\nThe structure of the comparison operators is shown in Figure 3-42, and each operator is briefly described in Table 3-1.The result of the comparison operator is true or false.\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n==\na == b is true if a and b have the same values, false if not\n\n\n!=\na != b is true if a != b and b are not equal, false if they are equal\n\n\n\na \n\n\n>\na > b is true if a is greater than b, false if less than or equal to b\n\n\n>=\na >= b is true if a is greater than or equal to b, false if less than b\n\n\n\na \n\n\n\nTable 3-1. Rego Comparison Operators\n\nFigure 3-42. Structure of comparison operators\nThe types of arithmetic operators are shown in Figure 3-43. Like a typical programming language, +, -, *, / means addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. The % operator that obtains the remainder, commonly called the modulo operator, is not represented in the grammar, but exists\n\nFigure 3-43. Structure of arithmetic operators\nSet Operator\nThe structure of the set operator is shown in Figure 3-44, and supports intersection (&) and join (|) operations. It is not grammatically indicated, but a minus(-) operator for set is also available.\n\nFigure 3-44. Structure of the set operator\nLet's test the set operators. The expected results can be seen by typing in REPL as follows..\n> {1,2,3} & {1,2}\n[\n    1,\n    2\n]\n> {1,2,3} | {1,2}\n[\n    1,\n    2,\n    3\n]\n> {1,2,3} - {1,2}\n[\n    3\n]\nEquality Operator\nRego has three operators related to equality: := (assignment), == (comparison), and = (unification). Allocation and comparison can only be used within a rule or in REPL, and the unification operator can be used in all cases. Let's first look at the difference between each.\nAssignment Operator\nThe allocation operator (:=) is the operator used to allocate values. When a value assignment is performed, a variable is created and a value is assigned. If you attempt to assign a value to the same variable (a variable with the same name) again, an error occurs.\nComparison Operator\nA comparison operator (==) is an operator whose values are the same. In addition to simple scalar values, complex values, and other values such as variables can be compared.\nUnification Operator\nA unification operator (=) is an operator that performs comparison and assignment simultaneously. Both operands behave the same as comparison operators if they are not variables, and if there are variables among them, they behave like assignment operators.\nExamples of the same results for assignment operators and unification operators are shown below. Both of the following lines create a variable called a and assign a value of 3.\na := 3\na = 3\nLet's also look at examples of the same comparison and unification operators, and both of the following lines return true..\n3 == 3\n3 = 3\nThe OPA official document describes the assignment operator and the comparison operator as grammatical sugar for the unification operator. Eventually, assignment operators and comparison operators are replaced by unification operators and compiled. However, the compiler encourages the use of high readability assignment operators and comparison operators over unification operators as error messages are clearer and can reduce confusion.\nHowever, since assignment operators and comparison operators can only be used within the rule body in more detail, there are many cases where unification operators such as default statements or rule heads are inevitable. Therefore, it seems appropriate to remember that it is good to use assignment operators and comparison operators if possible inside the rule body.\nComment\nLines that start with # letters are treated as comments to the end of the line. Blockwise annotations using / / are not supported, such as languages such as C++ and Java.\nExamples of comments are as follows:\n# default vaule for rule allowed\n# prevents allowed remains undefined\ndefault allowed = false\nReserved Name\nReserved names that cannot be utilized for reference using variable names, rule names, or reference using dot.\nas\ndefault\nelse\nfalse\nimport\npackage\nnot\nnull\ntrue\nwith\nWhere is main?\nOther common programming languages use the main function as the starting point, but does Rego correspond to the main function? The answer to this is that Rego, like SQL, works by returning a response to a query when querying data, so there is no special starting point. Rego reads and stores data (JSON format) and policies (rego files) and returns a response to the query when the user performs the query.\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we examined the language used by OPA to describe policy in detail, Rego. We visualize Rego's grammar as a railroad diagram, and also explore situations and examples of using real grammar. We also describe some examples of real-world behavior with minor errors or omissions in grammar when using real Rego.\nThe contents of this chapter are those that will continue to be referenced rather than read once. It will be helpful to check the policies written in Rego again when they behave differently than you think or encounter unknown errors.\nFor readers who want to find other explanatory material about Rego, please visit Torin Sandall's OPA deep dive slide at https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/rego-deep-dive.\nNext chapter deals with the various built-in functions provided by Rego, which are frequently used.\n"},"chap4/builtinfunction.html":{"url":"chap4/builtinfunction.html","title":"Chap 4.

OPA supports a variety of built-in functions needed to implement policies, such as encoding and JWT token processing, as well as built-in functions for basic functions such as type checking, strings, and regular expressions.\nThis chapter mainly describes the various built-in functions of OPA that are often used in policy writing. We also use the grammar in the previous chapter to write functions that are frequently used but not provided by OPA. However, the operators that OPA also describes as built-in functions are omitted if already described in Chapter 3.\n\nFigure 4-1. OPA built-in function reference\nFor referencing built-in functions, see https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#built-in-function on the OPA official homepage, as shown in Figure 4-1.\nIf the function described in the reference does not work, let's update the OPA version to the latest one. In other programming languages, built-in functions are documented from which version they are supported, but OPA does not provide information about which version they are supported. For example, the number.range() function is not supported in the version 0.19.x, the OPA version at the time this book was started, but it is supported in the latest version. These documentation details are a bit of a bummer for OPA.\nNumber Related Functions\nRound, Floor, Ceil\nOPA provides a rounding function named round. The round function returns a rounded value by receiving one numeric argument as follows.\n# 4\nround(4.3)\n\n# 11\nround(10.9)\n\n# 3\nround(3)\nAlthough previously not provided by OPA, the function \"floor\" and \"ceil\" is available in version 0.26.0, which was released in January 2021. Below 0.25.x, the error occurs as follows.\n$ opa run\nOPA 0.25.2 (commit 4c6e524, built at 2020-12-08T16:57:20Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands and check for updates.\n\n> floor(1.2)\n1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_type_error: undefined function floor\n>\nIn versions 0.26.0 and above, floor and ceil functions are included.\n$ opa run\nOPA 0.26.0 (commit 62d3900, built at 2021-01-20T18:56:12Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands and check for updates.\n\n> floor(1.2)\n1\nIf the OPA version of used cannot be changed, or if OPA versions below 0.25.x must be used, the floor or the ceil function are not provided, and should be defined directly if necessary.\nLet's define a floor function. The name of the function is floornew so that it does not conflict with the floor function of version 0.26.0 or higher. Since the rule body cannot write if or switch statement like  other generic programming language, the two rule bodies are linked with an else statement as follows\nfloornew(num) = round(num) { round(num) Running the floornew function yields the following integer values:\n# 4\nfloornew(4.3)\n\n# 10\nfloornew(10.9)\n\n# 3\nfloornew(3)\nSimilarly, the ceil function can be defined as:\nceilnew(num) = round(num) { round(num) >= num } else = (round(num) + 1)\nAbsolute Value\nThe abs function allows the absolute value of a number.\n# 10.4\nabs(-10.4)\n\n# 3\nabs(3)\nCreate an array of integers in a specific range\nThe numbers.range function produces an array of integers in the specified range. Typical range of similar functions has scope from first number to last number - 1. However, numbers.range produces an array containing both the preceding and the latter digits. Also, if the preceding number is greater than the latter, an array is created in reverse order from the preceding to the latter. Because the Rego language used by OPA does not have a direct for loop, the use of nubmers.range to create an integer array can similarly implement the for loop.\n# [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\nnumbers.range(9, 1)\n\n# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nnumbers.range(1, 9)\nBit Manipulation\nOPA supports bit manipulation functions as built-in functions rather than operators. The functions associated with bit operations provided are shown in Table 4-1.\n\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nbits.or(x, y)\nCalculate the bit OR of the two arguments\n\n\nbits.and(x, y)\nCalculate the bit AND of the two arguments\n\n\nbits.negate(x)\nFlip the bit. When called for integer arguments, return 2’s complement\n\n\nbits.xor(x, y)\nCalculate the bit XOR of the two arguments\n\n\nbits.lsh(x, s)\nShift x to the left by s\n\n\nbits.rsh(x, s)\nShift x to the right by s\n\n\n\nTable 4-1. Built-in Bit Manipulation Functions provided by OPA.\nType-Related Functions\nType Name\nBy using the type_name function, the type of variable passed as an argument can be obtained. Because type_name returns the result of a string type, type names can be easily compared using the == operator and etc.\nAn example of a function type_name is shown below. In the case of a composite value such as an array or set, the type is only known as \"set\", \"array\", and so on, so in order to know the specific type, the component of the composite value must be referenced and checked again.\n# \"number\"\ntype_name(3.14)\n\n# \"array\"\ntype_name([\"apple\",\"banana\",\"pineaplle\"])\n\n# \"set\"\ntype_name({\"apple\",\"banana\",\"pineaplle\"})\n\n# \"object\"\ntype_name({\"weight\":80, \"height\":180})\n\n# “boolean”\ndefault allowed = true\ntype_name(allowed)\n\n# undefined\nalwayswrong = { 1 == 2 }\ntype_name(alwayswrong)\nInvoking the type_name function for a rule returns the type for the evaluated result value of the rule. If the rule is not evaluated and the result is undefined, it becomes undefined.\nHowever, the function type_name cannot use the function itself as a target. An error occurs in REPL when the following code is entered.\nfunc(a) = r { r := a + 1}\ntype_name(func)\n\n2 errors occurred:\n1:11: rego_type_error: undefined ref: data.repl.func\ndata.repl.func\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nhave: number => number\n1:1: rego_type_error: type_name: invalid argument(s)\nhave: (number => number)\nwant: (any, string)\nIf you look at the contents of the error, you can see that type_name cannot be executed for the function. However, if the function is called and the resulting value is assigned to a variable, the resulting value will have a scalar value or complex value, so type_name for the variable containing the resulting value can be called.\n# \"number\"\ntype_name(func(3))\nType Checking Functions\nOPA provides built-in functions in the form is_ as shown in Table 4-2. These functions return true if an argument is of that type and undefined if not of that type.\n| Function         | Description                             |\n| is_number(x)     | Examine whether x is a numeric type     |\n| is_string(x)     | Examine whether x is a string type      |\n| is_boolean(x)    | Examine whether x is a boolean type     |\n| is_array(x)      | Examine whether x is an array type      |\n| is_set(x)        | Examine whether x is a set type         |\n| is_object(x)     | Examine whether x is a objecttype       |\n| is_null(x)       | Examine whether x is null               |\nTable 4-2. Type Checking Built-in Functions Provided by OPA.\nAn example of the use of type-check functions is as follows. Note that it returns undefined rather than false if it is not of that type.\n# undefined\nis_null(1)\n\n# true\nis_null(null)\n\n# undefined\nis_set({})\n\n# true\nis_set(set())\n\n# true\nis_object({})\n\n# true\nis_set({1,2,3})\n\n# true\nis_string(\"hello\")\nType Conversion Functions\nThe only type conversion function OPA currently supports is to_number. To_number returns 0 for a null or false and returns 1 for a true. If a string factor is passed, it returns the numerical value that the string represents. For example, if \"123\" is passed, it returns to 123. If the number type is passed, it is returned without being converted. An error occurs when a string is passed, not a numeric representation, and values other than the defined value are returned undefined.\n# 0\nto_number(null)\n\n# 0\nto_number(false)\n\n# undefined\nto_number(\"abc\")\n\n# 1234.45\nto_number(1234.45)\n\n#1234.45\nto_number(\"1234.45\")\nAggregation Function\nAn aggregation function of an OPA performs an aggregate operation on an array or set. Among aggregation functions, only counts receive strings or objects as an argument, while other aggregation functions can only use sets or arrays as an argument. Note that in OPA, strings are not an array of characters.\nNote again that in OPA, {} represents an object with no : pairs, so an empty set must be represented as a set(). \ncount\nThe count function can be used for strings, objects, sets, and arrays. When used for a string, it returns the length of the string, and when used for an object, it returns the number of : pairs. When used for a set or array, it returns the number of items that the set or array contains.\nExamples of use of the count function are as follows. count({}) returned 0 because {} is an object with a zero number of : pairs, and the count for the empty set(set()) was also returned 0.\n# 2\ncount({\"width\":1024, \"height\":768})\n\n# 12\ncount(\"hello woirld\")\n\n# 0\ncount([])\n\n# 0\ncount({})\n\n# 0\ncount(set()})\n\n# 3\ncount({1,2,3})\nsum, product, max and min\nThe sum, product, max, and min functions return the total sum, total product, maximum value, and minimum value of each element in an array or set taken over by an argument. An example of the use of each function is as follows:\n# -0.5\nsum({1, 0.5, -2})\n\n# -105\nproduct([1, 3, -5, 7])\n\n# -1\nmin({-1, 0, 1})\n\n# 3000.11\nmax( {10, 100, 3000.11 } )\nNote that if you run each function on an empty set or array, sum returns 0, product returns 1, min and max undefined, as follows.\n# 0\nsum(set())\n\n# 1\nproduct([])\n\n# undefined\nmin(set())\n\n# undefined\nmax([])\nall, any\nThe all function and any function return whether the elements in the array or set are all true or at least one true, respectively. Thus, if the resulting values of the associated rules are checked by all or any in a set or array, all rules can be checked for whether  all or any rule is satisfied.\nBefore looking at examples of the use of all or any, we define rules that are always judged to be true, always false, and undefined, respectively:\n#  It's always true.\nalwaystrue = true { true }\n\n# It's always false.\nalwaysfalse = false { true }\n\n# A rule that would be undefined if the default value was not declared, but it did not declare default.\nmaybeundefined { false }\nAn example of the use of all or any of the above rules is shown below. all returns true if the target array or set is all true or empty; any returns true only if any of the target arrays or sets contains true; and false if empty. Also, if an array or set contains undefined, all or any will be undefined.\n# true\nall([alwaystrue, alwaystrue])\n\n# false\nall([alwaystrue, alwaysfalse])\n\n# false\nall([true, 1])\n\n# true\nany([alwaystrue, alwaysfalse])\n\n# false\nany([alwaysfalse, alwaysfalse])\n\n# undefined\nall([alwaystrue, maybeundefined])\n\n# undefined\nany([alwaystrue, maybeundefined])\n\n# true\nall([])\n\n# false\nany([])\nComposite Value Related Functions\nArray related functions\nOPA provides functions that manipulatest arrays as shown in Table 4-3.\n| Function                                  | Description                                                                          |\n| array.concat(array1, array2)              | Returns the array that concatenates the two arrays that are passed  to the arguments   |\n| array.slice(array, startIndex, stopIndex) | Returns an array containing components ranging from startIndex to stopIndex(exclusive) |\nTable 4-3. Array manipulation built-in functions provided by OPA.\nAn example of the use of array related functions is as follows.\n# [1,2,3,4,5,4,5,6]\narray.concat([1,2,3,4,5],[4,5,6])\n\n# [0, 1, 2]\narray.slice([0,1,2,3,4,5], 0, 3)\n\n# [“c”]\narray.slice([\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"e\"], 2, 3)\nSet related Functions\nOPA provides intersection and union functions for the set in addition to the infix operators &(intersection), |(aggregation), and -(subset). The intersection function represents the intersection, and the union function represents the union, which, unlike the infix operator, is also possible to obtain the intersection and union for multiple sets at a time.\nNote that the sets to be passed to an intersection or union as arguments must be regrouped before passed. For example, to obtain a combination of {1,2} and {3,4}, you must call intersection { {1,2}, {3,4} } instead of intersection ( {1,2}, {3,4} ).\n# { 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6 }\nunion({ {1,3}, {2,4}, {5,6} })\n\n# { 1 }\nintersection({ {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,6} })\n\n# { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 }\nunion({ {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,6} })\nObject related Functions\nOPA provides a variety of functions to manipulate objects.\nobject.get\nobject.get has the form object.get(object, key, default) and returns the value with that key in the object.If there is no value (i.e., an object does not have a value for that key), it returns the value specified by default. An example of the use of object,get is as follows.\nobj := {\"key1\":\"val1\", \"key2\":\"val2\"}\n\n# “val1”\nobject.get(obj, \"key1\", null)\n\n# “val3”\nobject.get(obj, \"key3\", \"val3\")\nReference using [] or . will result in an error if the key does not exist in the object as follows. Although object.get always has to set a default value, there is a difference that no error occurs even if the key does not exist.\n> obj[“key3”]\n1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_type_error: undefined ref: data.repl.obj.key3\ndata.repl.obj.key3\n^\nhave: \"key3\"\nwant (one of): [\"key1\" \"key2\"]\n\n> obj.key3\n1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_type_error: undefined ref: data.repl.obj.key3\ndata.repl.obj.key3\n^\nhave: \"key3\"\nwant (one of): [\"key1\" \"key2\"]\nobject.remove\nobject.remove takes the form of object.remove(object, keys) and returns a new object that excludes keys and values corresponding to specific keys from the object. The keys argument has the form of a set or array. An example of using object.remove is as follows.\nobj := {\"name\":\"bob\", \"password\":\"1234\", \"role\":\"admin\", \"point\":1000}\n\n# { \"name\": \"bob\", \"point\": 1000 }\nobject.remove(obj, [\"password\",\"role\"])\n\nobject.union\nobject.union has the form  object.union(objectA, objectB) and combines the two objects to return a new object. If two objects have values for the same key, they are updated to the value of the second object.\n\n# { \"a\": \"c\", \"x\": { \"k\": \"v\", \"x\": 0 } }\nobject.union({\"a\":\"b\", \"x\":{\"k\":\"v\",\"x\":0}},{\"a\":\"c\"})\nobject.filter\nobject.filter has the form object.filter(object, keys) and returns a new object containing only values corresponding to that key, as opposed to object.remove excluding values for the specified key\nobj := {\"name\":\"bob\", \"password\":\"1234\", \"role\":\"admin\", \"point\":1000}\n\n# { \"password\": \"1234\", \"role\": \"admin\" }\nobject.filter(obj, [\"password\",\"role\"])\njson.filter\njson.filter has the form of json.filter(object,paths), which behaves similarly to object.filter, but can also be specified as a path, not as a top-level key. An example of the use of json.filter is as follows..\nobj := {\"a\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":200}, \"b\":{\"x\":400,\"y\":300}}\n\n# { \"a\": { \"x\": 100 }, \"b\": { \"x\": 400, \"y\": 300 } }\njson.filter(obj, [\"a/x\", \"b\"])\njson.remove\njson.remove has the form of json.remove(object,paths), which behaves similarly to object.remove, but also has a non-top key specified as a path. An example of the use of json.remove is as follows.\nobj := {\"a\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":200}, \"b\":{\"x\":400,\"y\":300}}\n\n# { \"a\": { \"y\": 200 } }\njson.remove(obj, [\"a/x\", \"b\"])\nString related Functions\nString Test Functions\ncontains\ncontains has the form of contains(string, search) and returns true if the string to be searched is included in the target string and false if not included.\n# true\ncontains(\"Hello, world\", \"Hello\")\n\n# false\ncontains(\"Hello, world\", \"hello\")\nindexof\nindexof has the form indexof (string, search), returns the index of the starting point where the string to be searched appears in the target string, and returns –1 if the string to be searched is not included in the target string.\n# 0\nindexof(\"Hello, world\", \"Hello\")\n\n# -1\nindexof(\"Hello, world\", \"hello\")\n\n# 7\nindexof(\"Hello, world\", \"world\")\nstartswith, endswith\nstartwith and endwith have the form startwith(string, search) and endwith(string, search), respectively, and return true or false if the target string begins or ends with that string.\n# true\nstartswith(\"Hello, world\", \"Hello\")\n\n# false\nstartswith(\"Hello, world\", \"hello\")\n\n# true\nendswith(\"Hello, world\", \"world\")\nFormat String\nsprintf\nsprintf has the form of sprintf(format, values). It generates strings that reflect the format, similar to the sprintf in other languages, such as the C language. Since OPA's Rego does not support variadic arguements, values passed to sprintf must be placed in an array.\n# \"hex (c9) == decimal (201)\\n\"\nsprintf(\"hex (%x) == decimal (%d)\\n\", [201,201])\nformat_int\nformat_int receives number and base to use, and returns a string that reflects the base of the numeric value. An example of using format_int is as follows.\n# \"b20\"\nformat_int(2848,16)\n\n# \"11110\"\nformat_int(30,2)\nCase Conversion\nThe upper and lower functions allow for easy case conversion. upper and lower take over the string to be converted and return the string converted to uppercase and lowercase, respectively.\n# \"HELLO\"\nupper(\"Hello\")\n\n# \"hello\"\nlower(\"Hello\")\nString Manipulation Functions\nconcat\nconcat has a concat (delimiter, array_or_set) format, and concatenate strings passed to an array or set into one using a specified separator. A delimiter is a string format as the first factor, and an array or set must contain only strings. Examples of uses include:\n# \"hello****world****!\"\nconcat(\"****\" , [\"hello\", \"world\", \"!\"])\n\n# \"apple.banana.pineapple\"\nconcat(\".\" , [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"pineapple\"])\nsplit\nsplit is the form of split (string, delimiter) and, as opposed to concat, splits the string by separator and returns the string array. Examples of uses include:\n# [\"hello\", \"world\", \"!\"])\nsplit(\"hello****world****!\", \"****\")\n\n# [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"pineapple\"]\nsplit(\"apple.banana.pineapple\", \".\")\n\n# [\"apple.banana.pineaplle\"]\nsplit(\"apple.banana.pineaplle\", \" \")\nsubstring\nA substring has the form of a substring (string, start, length) and returns a string from which a portion is extracted. The starting position starts at zero, and an error occurs if it is negative. It returns a string of length from the start position, and a zero indicates an empty string, and if length of a negative means start from to end of the string.\n# \"1234\"\nsubstring(\"123456789\", 0, 4)\n\n# \"4567\"\nsubstring(\"123456789\", 3, 4)\n\n# \"456789\"\nsubstring(\"123456789\", 3, -1)\n\n# 1 error occurred: substring(\"123456789\", -1, 4): eval_builtin_error: substring: negative offset\nsubstring(\"123456789\", -1, 4)\nreplace\nreplace takes the form of replace (string, old, new) and changes certain parts of a string to other content. Simply put, everything in the editor works like finding and replacing. Since they are all found and replaced, regular expressions should be used in situations such as changing only when first discovered. Examples of uses of replace include:\n# \"1X1X111XXX111111111\"\nreplace(\"1010111000111111111\",\"0\",\"X\")\n\n# \"applepie\"\nreplace(\"applebanana\",\"banana\",\"pie\")\nstrings.replace_n\nstrings.replace_n has the form of strings.replace_n (patterns, strings), and the difference with replace is that multiple strings can be replaced at once by creating a key and a value object. If multiple strings need to be replaced, it is more efficient than calling replace multiple times. Examples of uses of strings.replace_n include:\n# \"Pine_Apple“\nstrings.replace_n( {\"pine\":\"Pine\", \"apple\":\"Apple\"}, \"pine_apple\")\nTrim String\ntrim_space\ntrim_space has the form of trim_space (string) and removes spaces at the front and back of the string (such as space characters, tab characters, open characters, and so on). Examples of uses include:\n# \"this is trim test\"\ntrim_space(\" this is trim test\\n\")\ntrim, trim_left and trim_right\ntrim, trim_left, trim_right has trim(string, cutset), trim_left(string, cutset), and trim_right(string, cutset) formats, respectively, eliminating characters belonging to strings handed to the cutset part. Trim is removed from both sides, trim_left and trim_right from the left. Because OPA does not have a character type and does not treat a string as an array of characters, the cutset argument that uses a string as a set of characters is a special case only in the trim function and requires attention. Examples of uses include:\n# \"Hello, world“\ntrim(\"Hello, world\", \", \")\n\n# \"this is trim test\"\ntrim(\" this is trim test\\n\", \"\\n \")\n\n# \"this is trim test\"\ntrim(\".... this is trim test\\n\", \".\\n \")\n\n# \"this is trim test“\ntrim(\".... \\nthis is trim test\\n\", \".\\n \")\n\n# \"this is trim test\\n“\ntrim_left(\".... \\nthis is trim test\\n\", \".\\n \")\n\n# \".... \\nthis is trim test\"\ntrim_right(\".... \\nthis is trim test\\n\", \".\\n \")\ntrim_prefix, trim_suffix\ntrim_prefix and trim_suppix have the form trim_prefix(string, prefix) and trim_suppix(string, prefix), respectively, and remove the specified prefix or suffix (postfix). If the prefix or suffix pattern does not match, the original string is returned. Examples of uses include:\n# \"** message *****“\ntrim_prefix(\"***** message *****\", \"***\")\n\n# \" message *****\"\ntrim_prefix(\"***** message *****\", \"*****\")\n\n# \"***** message *“\ntrim_suffix(\"***** message *****\", \"****\")\nRegular Expression Related Functions\nSince the runtime of OPA is implemented in the Go language, the regular expression grammar used is the same as the regular expression used in the Go language, and for accurate grammar, see https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax. This book does not deal directly with regular expression grammar.\nregex.is_valid\nregex.is_valid checks if a string passed over to an argument fits the regular expression format supported by OPA. If the format is supported by OPA, it will return true and return false if it is not supported, but if the format cannot be recognized as regular expression at all, it will result in an illegal token error. Because OPA does not support all regular expression formats, if the regular expression does not behave as expected, it can be used to determine whether the regular expression itself is a supported format. However, since the regular expression format supported by OPA and the interpretation in some sense are different, you should check https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax if the format works differently even if it matches. Examples of use of regex.is_valid include:\n# true\nregex.is_valid(\"[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]+\")\n\n# 1:16: rego_parse_error: illegal token\nregex.is_valid(\"\\d+\")\n\n# true\nregex.is_valid(\"\\\\d+\")\n\n# false\nregex.is_valid(\"\\\\o+\")\nregex.match\nregex.match has the form regex.match (pattern, value) and checks whether a particular string satisfies the corresponding regular expression pattern. For example, [:alpha:]][:al num:]* is a regular expression that begins with an alphabet and can be followed by more than 0 arbitrary numbers or characters. If this expression is examined with regex.match, a1000000 and abcde are matched, but not 9ab0000 or 30000. Regex.match allows you to check whether the data entered is appropriate for the desired format. Examples of uses of regex.match include:\n# true\nregex.match(\"[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]*\", \"a100000\")\n\n# true\nregex.match(\"[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]*\", \"abcde\")\n\n# false\nregex.match(\"[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]*\", \"10000\")\nregex.split\nregex.split returns the result of splitting a string into an array, using a regular expression pattern as a separator, rather than a simple string as a separator. Examples of uses of regex.split include:\n# [ \"\", \"12234\", \"9999\" ]\nregex.split(\"[\\\\*|\\\\+|\\\\-|x]+\", \"****12234xxxxx9999\")\n\n# [ \"111\", \"111\", \"4444\", \"5555\" ]\nregex.split(\"[\\\\*|\\\\+|\\\\-|x]+\", \"111-111*4444x5555\"\nregex.globs_match\nregex.globs_match compares two simple regular expressions at the Glob level to examine whether one is a relationship that is included in the other. For example, a+ matches \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\", ... with at least one a, but a matches empty strings and includes all that a+ matches such as   \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\", ... .  Relationships show that a+ is a subset of a. It returns true if these relationships are satisfied, and true even if they are identical (subset to each other). The OPA official document states that it only supports glob symbols such as .(dot), *, +, [, -, ], \\, etc., and is only applicable to very simple forms of regular expressions. Examples of uses of regex.globs_match include: \n# false\nregex.globs_match(\"a+\",\"ab\")\n\n# true\nregex.globs_match(\"ab+\",\"ab\")\n\n# true\nregex.globs_match(\"ab+\",\"ab*\")\nregex.template_match\nregex.template_match has the form of regex.template_match (pattern, string, delimiter_start, delimiter_end), matching only the parts between the two arguments(delimiter_start, delimiter_end) as regular expressions, and matching the rest as regular strings. The entire matching can be expressed as a regular expression, but matching only between delimiters as a regular expression also increases readability, and the rest will be handled much more efficiently because simple string comparisons are performed. It is not allowed to use blank characters or :(colons) as delimiters, and it is safe to use parentheses. Examples of uses of regex.template_match include:\n# true\nregex.template_match(\"t-(10+)-235\", \"t-10000-235\", \"(\", \")\")\n\n# false\nregex.template_match(\"t-(10+)-235\", \"t-20000-235\", \"(\", \")\")\n\n# true\nregex.template_match(\"ast-[ab+]-235\", \"ast-abbbb-235\", \"[\", \"]\")\n\n# true\nregex.template_match(\"ast-(ab+]-235\", \"ast-abbbb-235\", \"(\", \"]\")\nregex.find_n\nregex.find_n has the form regex.find_n (pattern, string, number), returns the matching part of the regular expression by the number argument, and returns the entire number if the number is –1. Examples of uses of regex.find_n include:\n# [ \"abc\", \"bbb\" ]\nregex.find_n(\"[[:alpha:]]+\", \"123abc00bbb1111ccc\", 2)\n\n# [ \"ABC\", \"CCC\", \"XX\" ]\nregex.find_n(\"[A-Z]+\", \"ABC0000abCCCabcXX222\", 3)\nregex.find_all_string_submatch_n\nregex.find_all_string_submatch_n has the format regex.find_all_string_submatch_n(pattern, string, number) and returns a list of submatching including capture groups of regular expressions. The regular expression used in OPA is recognized as a capture group if the part of the regular expression is wrapped in ( ) and must be wrapped in (?: and ) for escape. Let's first look at an example to illustrate the capture group. Suppose you have a regular expression such as a(b)c(f)d, and call regex.find_all_string_submatch_n for each string \"acd\", \"abcfffffd\" that matches the regular expression. In the example, the number factor is set to –1 to match the whole.\n# [ [ \"acd\", \"\", \"\" ] ]\nregex.find_all_string_submatch_n(\"a(b*)c(f*)d\", \"acd\", -1)\n\n# [ [ \"abcd\", \"b\", \"\" ] ]\nregex.find_all_string_submatch_n(\"a(b*)c(f*)d\", \"abcd\", -1)\n\n# [ [ \"abbcfffffd\", \"bb\", \"fffff\" ] ]\nregex.find_all_string_submatch_n(\"a(b*)c(f*)d\", \"abbcfffffd\", -1)\nIn the case of \"acd\", the first capture group (b) is matched to b is repeated more than 0 times and the second capture group (f) is also matched  f* is matched to f is repeated more than 0 times.  [\"acd\", \"\", \"\" ] was returned because the matching string was \"acd\" and two capture groups were matched to  empty strings.  In the case of \"abcd\", the matching string is \"abcd\" and the first capture group matched to \"b\",  and the second capture group matched the empty string, so  [\"abcd\", \"b\", \"\"] was returned. For \"abbcfffffd\", [abbcfffffd\", \"bb\", \"fffff\"] was returned because “bb” were matched in the first capture group and “fffff” in the second capture group.\nLet's escape the capture groups one by one and look at the results. As expected, we can confirm that the escaped part is not recognized as a capture group, and that the content about that part is excluded in the results.\n# [ [ \"abbcfffffd\", \"bb\" ] ]\nregex.find_all_string_submatch_n(\"a(b*)c(?:f*)d\", \"abbcfffffd\", -1)\n\n# [ [ \"abcd\", \"\" ] ]\nregex.find_all_string_submatch_n(\"a(?:b*)c(f*)d\", \"abcd\", -1)\nIf the strings to be matched are matched by multiple regular expressions, the matched strings and capture groups for each part are returned in an array.\n# [ [ \"acd\", \"\", \"\" ], [ \"abcd\", \"b\", \"\" ], [ \"abbcfffffd\", \"bb\", \"fffff\" ] ]\nregex.find_all_string_submatch_n(\"a(b*)c(f*)d\", \"acd__abcd0000abbcfffffd\", 3)\nGlob related Functions\nGlob is a widely used pattern for file path matching and is a feature provided by almost any programming language. For example, use .jpg to refer to files with the extension jpg, or use  ./**/.java to specify all java files in the subdirectory of the current directory.Using java is the glob pattern. Because organizations and permissions have hierarchical structures like files, glob can also be useful in implementing permissions and policies. \nGlob Patterns\nThe Glob patterns used in Glob matching are shown in Table 4-4.\n\n\n\nWildcard\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\n?\nMatch one character\n?at matches cat and bat, but not at\n\n\n*\nMatch at least 0 characters\n*kg matches both 1 kg and 10000 kg\n\n\n**\nMatch at least 0 characters across delimiter boundaries\n*/.rego matches both chap1/sample.rego book/source/chap1/sample.rego if separator is /\n\n\n[abc]\nMatch one of the characters in [ ]\n[bh]at matches bat and hat, but not cat\n\n\n[a-z]\nMatch the range of characters in [ ]\n[1-3]g matches 1g, 2g, 3g, etc., but does not match 6g\n\n\n[!abc]\nAny of the characters in [! ] do not match\n[!c]at matches bat but cat doesn't match\n\n\n\nTable 4-4. Glob patterns used by OPA.\nGlob Matching\nIt is important for OPA to match glob patterns with specific strings because comparisons to implement policies are the main purpose of the OPA. Functions to handle glob matching are provided in the form of glob.match (pattern, delayers, match). What is unusual is that the delimiters argument that specifies the separator is passed as an array, and if you pass [], \".\" is used. Examples of uses include:\n# true\nglob.match(\"?at\", [], \"bat\")\n\n# false\nglob.match(\"[bh]at\", [], \"cat\")\n\n# true\nglob.match(\"[!bh]at\", [], \"cat\")\n\n# false\nglob.match(\"[1-4]kg\", [], \"6kg\")\n\n# false\nglob.match(\"*.com\", [\".\"], \"test.example.com\")\n\n# true\nglob.match(\"*.com\", [\"/\"], \"test.example.com\")\n\n# true\nglob.match(\"**.com\", [\".\"], \"test.example.com\")\n\n# true\nglob.match(\"**.com\", [\".\",\"/\"], \"test/example.com\")\n\n#false\nglob.match(\"*.com\", [\".\",\"/\"], \"test/example.com\")\nEscaping\nAlthough it is a string in the form of a glob pattern, there may be occasions when you want to treat the content as a string itself, not as a glob pattern. To this end, OPA provides a function for escape processing. The glob.quote_meta function has the form of glob.quote_meta(pattern)  and returns an escaped string. Examples of uses include:\n# \"\\\\*.test.com\"\nglob.quote_meta(\"*.test.com\")\n\n# \"\\\\*\\\\*/\\\\*.rego\"\nglob.quote_meta(\"**/*.rego\")\nHTTP related functions\nhttp.send function has response := http.It has a send(request) format. Both request and response are objects and each has the required fields for HTTP requests and responses. An example of the use of http.send is as follows. The test used a popular public server, httpbin.org, for HTTP testing.\n> http.send({\"url\":\"http://httpbin.org/post\", \"method\":\"post\", \"timeout\":\"3s\", \"headers\":{\"token\":\"111\"}, \"body\":{\"key\": \"val\"}})\n{\n  \"body\": {\n    \"args\": {},\n    \"data\": \"{\\\"key\\\":\\\"val\\\"}\",\n    \"files\": {},\n    \"form\": {},\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"Accept-Encoding\": \"gzip\",\n      \"Content-Length\": \"13\",\n      \"Host\": \"httpbin.org\",\n      \"Token\": \"111\",\n      \"User-Agent\": \"Open Policy Agent/0.35.0 (linux, amd64)\",\n      \"X-Amzn-Trace-Id\": \"Root=1-61cff125-334989227ad1766c0afef490\"\n    },\n    \"json\": {\n      \"key\": \"val\"\n    },\n    \"origin\": \"220.88.72.55\",\n    \"url\": \"http://httpbin.org/post\"\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"access-control-allow-credentials\": [\n      \"true\"\n    ],\n    \"access-control-allow-origin\": [\n      \"*\"\n    ],\n    \"content-length\": [\n      \"440\"\n    ],\n    \"content-type\": [\n      \"application/json\"\n    ],\n    \"date\": [\n      \"Sat, 01 Jan 2022 06:13:57 GMT\"\n    ],\n    \"server\": [\n      \"gunicorn/19.9.0\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"raw_body\": \"{\\n  \\\"args\\\": {}, \\n  \\\"data\\\": \\\"{\\\\\\\"key\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"val\\\\\\\"}\\\", \\n  \\\"files\\\": {}, \\n  \\\"form\\\": {}, \\n  \\\"headers\\\": {\\n    \\\"Accept-Encoding\\\": \\\"gzip\\\", \\n    \\\"Content-Length\\\": \\\"13\\\", \\n    \\\"Host\\\": \\\"httpbin.org\\\", \\n    \\\"Token\\\": \\\"111\\\", \\n    \\\"User-Agent\\\": \\\"Open Policy Agent/0.35.0 (linux, amd64)\\\", \\n    \\\"X-Amzn-Trace-Id\\\": \\\"Root=1-61cff125-334989227ad1766c0afef490\\\"\\n  }, \\n  \\\"json\\\": {\\n    \\\"key\\\": \\\"val\\\"\\n  }, \\n  \\\"origin\\\": \\\"220.88.72.55\\\", \\n  \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://httpbin.org/post\\\"\\n}\\n\",\n  \"status\": \"200 OK\",\n  \"status_code\": 200\n}\nThe required fields of the request object in http.send are url and method, and if the method is POST, the contents can be passed to the body field, and the headers field allows the HTTP header to pass tokens and so on for API calls. You can also use the timeout field to change the default timeout of 5 seconds. Since the result of http.send calls is returned to the object, assigning the result of http.send to a variable makes it easier to access the object's fields and process only the necessary information. For more information on the fields of request and response objects, see the official document (https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#http).\n> response := http.send({\"url\":\"http://httpbin.org/post\", \"method\":\"post\", \"timeout\":\"3s\", \"headers\":{\"token\":\"111\"}, \"body\":{\"key\": \"val\"}})\nRule 'response' defined in package repl.

Since it is not often necessary to sign JWT within a policy, this book only introduces functions related to decoding and validation. Signing functions can also be useful when writing test codes, such as unit tests, so refer to official documents for interested readers. First, let's go to jwt.io and create a JWT for the test. As shown in Figure 4-2, the signature algorithm HS512, the header is {\"alg\": \"HS512\", \"type\": \"JWT\"}, the payload is {\"sub\":\"1234567890\", \"name\":\"OPA Test\", \"iat\": 1516239022}. Secret code is set to secret.\n \nFigure 4-2. Creating a JWT for testing\nThe resulting code appears in the Encoded section in the following form.\neyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6Ik9QQSBUZXN0IiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.962LwX8r2s-pGHgD1JlITvEtaLnNjXrssZAiLoelx2AOjN8Ch7HXxaH38312vLwk_FlE5VoESB3FxFswLnD8dQ\nJWT Decoding Function\nJWT can be decoded by calling io.jwt.decode(token). The token argument is in string format, and JWT itself is separated by a . and consists of header, payload and signature, each encoded in an enhanced Base64 encoding available for URLs. The JWT decoding function performs only decoding and does not validate the signature itself. For example, the io.jwt.decode result was returned as an array, with the first part being the header of the JWT and the second part being the payload, both of which being objects. The last is a string containing the signature part.\n> io.jwt.decode(\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6Ik9QQSBUZXN0IiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.962LwX8r2s-pGHgD1JlITvEtaLnNjXrssZAiLoelx2AOjN8Ch7HXxaH38312vLwk_FlE5VoESB3FxFswLnD8dQ\")\n[\n  {\n    \"alg\": \"HS512\",\n    \"typ\": \"JWT\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"iat\": 1516239022,\n    \"name\": \"OPA Test\",\n    \"sub\": \"1234567890\"\n  },\n  \"f7ad8bc17f2bdacfa9187803d499484ef12d68b9cd8d7aecb190222e87a5c7600e8cdf0287b1d7c5a1f7f37d76bcbc24fc5944e55a04481dc5c45b302e70fc75\"\n]\nJWT Signature Verification\nFunctions validating JWT signatures have the form io.jwt.verify_ (string, secret_or_certificate). To verify JWT signed by the HS512 algorithm, the function io.jwt.verfiy_hs512 can be used. If the signature algorithm is RS512, io.jwt.verify_rs512 can be used. The secret_or_certificate argument is either a secret code or a string containing the public key, depending on the algorithm. If verification is successful, the true is returned.\nIn the previous example, we validate the JWT generated by the HS512 algorithm, the secret code \"secret\", and the results are as follows.\n> io.jwt.verify_hs512(\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6Ik9QQSBUZXN0IiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.962LwX8r2s-pGHgD1JlITvEtaLnNjXrssZAiLoelx2AOjN8Ch7HXxaH38312vLwk_FlE5VoESB3FxFswLnD8dQ\", \"secret\")\ntrue\nOPA provides an io.jwt.decode_verify function that simultaneously handles decoding and validation of tokens. io.jwt.decode_verify has the form of io.jwt.decode_verify(string, constraints) and argument constraints is an object. Examples of uses of the function io.jwt.decode_verify are as follows.

Using these features will reduce the code that rechecks on the decoded token. For more information, see the official document (https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#token-verification).\nSummary\nThis chapter focuses on the various built-in functions provided by OPA that can be useful in policy writing. Built-in functions allow a variety of operations, such as extracting values from objects and transforming values, to compare policies beyond simple comparisons using the median operator. Complex pattern matching such as regular expressions and globs can also be performed. \nIn the next chapter, we use the Rego grammar described in the previous chapter and the built-in functions described in this chapter to write policies that could be used in the actual development process.\n"},"chap5/writingpolicy.html":{"url":"chap5/writingpolicy.html","title":"Chap 5.

First, let's assume aㅜ API authorization policy that can be utilized in real-world applications and write a scenario for that. First of all, basic API access rights are implemented as OPA policies, and then explained by defining various requirements and expanding existing policies.\nBasic Scenario\nRequirements\nThe API authorization required for typical systems is assumed at a basic level as follows.\n1) End-user, administrator, and operator roles exist in the system.\n2) APIs are defined in REST format, and API calling privileges are defined in pairs of {URL, HTTP methods}.\n3) If a user logs in, the user ID and role information are recorded in the session.\n4) If you have the role of system administrator, you can call the entire API.\n5) Operators are granted permission on a permission group basis. A permission group is a group of API call permissions that are related to each other.\n6) An operator can call APIs belonging to permission groups granted by an administrator without restriction.\n7) When the user calls the API, the API call can be permitted if the target resource is owned by the user.\nTaking the actual API call process as an example, the above policy is as follows. Suppose you have access to an API that can query user profiles. For example, suppose /users/{user_id}/profile has a function that looks up the user profile by invoking the GET method. The system administrator can call the entire API, so it can call the API. Operators can only invoke APIs if they have GET privileges at least one of the following URL: /users, /users/{user_id}, /users/{user_id}/profile. Users can invoke APIs that correspond to users/{user_id} because they are associated with the user themselves.\nFor sources related to this scenario, refer to the chap5/basic directory.\nInput Schema Definition\nLet's define the schema of OPA inputs as the first step to implementing a policy. To determine API privileges, you first need to know about the API that is called now, and you need the user ID and user role information in the user session. It is also necessary to know which users' information is handled by the API being called. To include this information, we define the OPA input schema with the following JSON objects:\n{\n  \"api\" : {\n    \"url\" : \"\",\n    \"method\": \"\",\n    \"target_user_id\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"user\" : {\n    \"id\": \"\",\n    \"role\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe OPA does not currently provide functions such as defining and checking input schemas. -> currently input schema supported. Therefore, the OPA input must be checked by an external program and handed over to the OPA or checked within the Lego script. In this book, we assume that validated inputs from external programs are handed over and continue explaining.\nData Definitions\nSince the definition of input passed as a factor in each policy decision in OPA has been completed, let's also create data schemas and data that serve as a database for judgment. First, let's define API access.\nIt is defined to be located under the key \"api\" so that it can be distinguished from other data at the top of API access. Furthermore, under the api key, the URL of each API is keyed to define the access authority object. API URLs can be included in objects and defined as API object arrays, but access to URLs with keys is more efficient than touring in arrays when querying APIs. The OPA official document also recommends defining objects (from the perspective of the entire data as objects with url as the key and API information as objects rather than arrays.\n{\n  \"api\": {\n    \"/users/{user_id}/profile\" : {\n      \"GET\": [\"profile.read\"],\n      \"PUT\": [\"profile.update\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn the example above, the object is defined again with the key \"/users/{user_id}/profile\" and GET and PUT are defined as the value of the array. This scenario assumes a REST API, so if you need to define permissions other than GET and PUT, you can add POST, DELETE, PATCH, etc. The reason for declaring permissions as an array is to represent situations in which multiple permissions are required to perform a particular API.\nNext, let's define permissions for the operator. The key to store operator permissions defines \"operator_permission\" at the same level as the \"api\" key previously defined. An id is keyed for each operator, and permissions for each operator are stored as an array of strings. An operator with operator1 id has two privileges: profile.read and profile.update, and can access APIs that require those privileges.\n\"operator_permission\" : {\n  \"oper1\" : [\"profile.read\",\"profile.update\"],\n  \"oper2\" : [\"profile.read\"]\n}\n\nThe complete file was saved as data.json as follows:\n{\n  \"api\": {\n    \"/users/{user_id}/profile\" : {\n      \"GET\": \"profile.read\",\n      \"PUT\": \"profile.update\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"operator_permission\" : {\n    \"oper1\" : [\"profile.read\",\"profile.update\"],\n    \"oper2\" : [\"profile.read\"]\n  }\n}\n\nWriting Policy\nLet's write a Rego rule that carries out policy judgments. First of all, the package was named sample.basic because it was the default scenario. A variable indicating whether or not it has access was declared allowed, and false was assigned by default so that it would not be undefined if no rule was satisfied.\npackage example.basic\n\ndefault allowed = false\nThe rules for granting full rights to administrators are as follows: The name of the rule was allowed, the same as the variable, and the input's user object role property was \"ADMIN\", so that if \"ADMIN\" then the rule would be true.\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"ADMIN\"\n}\nThe second rule is a rule that grants permission to the user, and it becomes true if the three conditions as follows are met.\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"USER\"\n  input.user.target_user_id != \"\"\n  input.user.target_user_id == input.user.id\n}\nThe first condition is that the user object’s  role property of input must be \"USER\". The second condition checks that the user object target_user_id value in the input is not empty and compares whether the user object id and target_id in the input are the same under the third condition, which is meaningless if they are both empty strings.  The third condition compares the id of the authenticated session with the id of the owner of the resource being processed.\nThe last rule deals with cases in which the role of the user is an operator.\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"OPERATOR\"\n  permission := data.operator_permission[input.user.id]\n  required_permission := data.api[input.api.url][input.api.method]\n\n  some p\n  permission[p] == required_permission\n}\nThe first line verifies that the role property of the user object in the input is \"OPERATOR\". The second line uses the user id of the input as the key in the defined data to read the operator's permissions and then assign them to the permission variable. The third line uses the url and method properties of the inputted api object as keys to query the permissions required by api and assign it to the required_permission variable. The line then declares the local variable p. Then, when an element with the same value as required_permission is found while iterating the permission array, the index of that element is assigned to p.\nLet's collect all the contents above and save them as policy.rego as follows. The content is simply a continuation of the previous content. Subsequent examples do not introduce the full content, so please download and refer to the source.\npackage example.basic\n\ndefault allowed = false\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"ADMIN\"\n}\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"USER\"\n  input.user.target_user_id != \"\"\n  input.user.target_user_id == input.user.id\n}\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"OPERATOR\"\n  permission := data.operator_permission[input.user.id]\n  required_permission := data.api[input.api.url][input.api.method]\n\n  some p\n  permission[p] == required_permission\n}\nTesting Policy\nLet's test whether the policy actually works as wanted. Unit tests for policies can also be written in Rego, but first, let's test permissions for administrators.\nSave the following as policy_test.rego.\npackage example.basic\n\ntest_admin_allowed {\n  allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"ADMIN\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}/profile\",\n      \"method\" : \"GET\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe package was in sample.basic, the same as the policy. First of all, a rule was written to test the administrator's permissions, named testadmin_allowed. OPA recognizes a rule that begins with test as a test case. A rule is written with one with statement, which evaluates whether allowed is true when the input is equal to the object after as. Since the criteria for determining administrator recognition were to check whether the role property was \"ADMIN\", the role attribute was written as ADMIN. The url and method properties of api are specified by randomly selecting one from the data. Other properties, such as id, are irrelevant and are not specified, but it is also a good habit to specify them in a realistic form. Whether the overall test will be sufficient just by specifying the properties can be confirmed by the test coverage described in other parts of the book.\nLet's test using the opa tool to meet the rules. If the test case files, policy files, and JSON data files are passed to arguments of the opa test command, it shows whether the test case succeeds or fails.\n$ opa test policy_test.rego policy.rego data.json\nPASS: 1/1\nWhen running the opa test, the –v option is added to provide more detailed information, including the rule's name and running time.\n$ opa test -v policy_test.rego policy.rego data.json\ndata.example.basic.test_admin_allowed: PASS (970.2µs)\nPASS: 1/1\nIf the role in the test case is changed to AMIN instead of ADMIN, the test will fail.\nLet's add more test cases to make it a more practical test. This time, let's write a test case to test the operator account. Write the following and add it to the policy_test.rego you created earlier.\ntest_oper1_profile_read_allowed {\n  allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"oper1\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}/profile\",\n      \"method\" : \"GET\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nAs can be easily expected, the above is a test case that checks whether a user with id is OPER1 and role is OPERATOR is authorized to invoke GET requests for /users/{user_id}/profile APIs. /users/{user_id}/profile is a URL for a user's profile and the method is GET, so you can guess that it is an API that reads the user profile.  The test case was named test_oper1_profile_read_allowed because it is a test that checks whether the user profile can be read by the operator1 user. In the previously written data, the user has rights to the API and should be allowed.\nThe data written earlier shows that operator1 has PUT privileges as well as GET for /users/{user_id}/profile. Thus, in the case of PUTs, only the method property of api was changed to add a test case named test_oper1_profile_update_allowed.\ntest_oper1_profile_update_allowed {\n  allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"oper1\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}/profile\",\n      \"method\" : \"PUT\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nLet's write a test case for oper2 this time. Unlike oper1, which has both read and update privileges to user profiles, oper2 has read privileges only. The test_oper2_profile_read_allowed test cases for read permissions are as follows: It can be seen that other content except user id is the same as the test_oper1_profile_read_allowed test case.\ntest_oper2_profile_read_allowed {\n  allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"oper2\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}/profile\",\n      \"method\" : \"GET\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThis time, let's make sure that the oper2 user does not have permission to update the user profile. The test_oper2_profile_update_not_allowed test case used the not statement for the first time. If you want to make sure that the result is false when you write another test case, you can attach a not keyword in front of the door with the test case.\ntest_oper2_profile_update_not_allowed {\n  not allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"oper2\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}/profile\",\n      \"method\" : \"PUT\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nNext time, let's make a test case for the user. The user is granted permission if the user's role attribute is USER and the id and target_id match.\ntest_user_allowed {\n  allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"USER\",\n      \"id\" : \"user1\",\n      \"target_user_id\" : \"user1\",\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}/profile\",\n      \"method\" : \"PUT\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nTo create an disallowed test case by changing the target_user_id value of the user object:\ntest_user_not_allowed {\n  not allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"USER\",\n      \"id\" : \"user1\",\n      \"target_user_id\" : \"user2\",\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}/profile\",\n      \"method\" : \"PUT\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nSince we have prepared various test cases for the policy, let's test them to see if they work well. The opa test command, as follows, confirms that all of the tests are successful.\n$ opa test -v policy_test.rego policy.rego data.json\ndata.example.basic.test_admin_allowed: PASS (971.2µs)\ndata.example.basic.test_oper1_profile_read_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.basic.test_oper1_profile_update_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.basic.test_oper2_profile_read_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.basic.test_oper2_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (1.0408ms)\ndata.example.basic.test_user_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.basic.test_user_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 7/7\nTo measure more accurate performance, you can add the --bench option when running the test.\n$ opa test –v –t 10s --bench policy.rego policy_test.rego data.json\ndata.example.basic.test_admin_allowed 37602 33966 ns/op 24819 timer_rego_query_eval_ns/op\n9300 B/op 170 allocs/op\ndata.example.basic.test_oper1_profile_read_allowed 25687 47053 ns/op 349 timer_rego_external_resolve_ns/op 37582 timer_rego_query_eval_ns/op 12788 B/op 241 allocs/op\ndata.example.basic.test_oper1_profile_update_allowed 25747 46019 ns/op 117 timer_rego_external_resolve_ns/op 35928 timer_rego_query_eval_ns/op 12788 B/op 241 allocs/op\ndata.example.basic.test_oper2_profile_read_allowed 25224 46035 ns/op 199 timer_rego_external_resolve_ns/op 36162 timer_rego_query_eval_ns/op 12572 B/op 236 allocs/op\ndata.example.basic.test_oper2_profile_update_not_allowed 23569 48003 ns/op 170 timer_rego_external_resolve_ns/op 38563 timer_rego_query_eval_ns/op 14405 B/op 258 allocs/op\ndata.example.basic.test_user_allowed 31176 37074 ns/op 27546 timer_rego_query_eval_ns/op\n10259 B/op 186 allocs/op\ndata.example.basic.test_user_not_allowed 30032 41724 ns/op 32272 timer_rego_query_eval_ns/op 12092 B/op 208 allocs/op\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 7/7\nThe output results are described in order of name of the rule, number of samples, execution time in nanoseconds, time spent evaluating the rule, memory quota in bytes, and memory allocation retrieval. Using benchmark options, the results are informed in nanoseconds by repeated execution of the test, so that the performance can be compared even if the rule is simple and the execution ends quickly.\nTracing queries for debugging\nLet's see how the query written is evaluated. If you turn on trace using REPL, you can see how the query is evaluated. Let's read the rules and data into REPL with the opa run command as follows.\n$ opa run policy.rego data.json\nOPA 0.26.0 (commit 62d3900, built at 2021-01-20T18:56:12Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands and check for updates.\n\nOnce the rules and data are loaded, the tracing can be turned on by typing trace as follows: The tracing works as a toggle, so you can turn off the tracing after entering the trace command once more. Assigning an object to input allows you to set inputs for evaluation, followed by querying data.example.basic.allowed to output intermediate trace results.\n\n> trace\n> input := {\"user\":{\"role\":\"ADMIN\"}}\nRule 'input' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n> data.example.basic.allowed\nquery:1 Enter data.example.basic.allowed = _\nquery:1 | Eval data.example.basic.allowed = _\nquery:1 | Index data.example.basic.allowed (matched 1 rule)\npolicy.rego:5 | Enter data.example.basic.allowed\npolicy.rego:6 | | Eval input.user.role = \"ADMIN\"\npolicy.rego:5 | | Exit data.example.basic.allowed\nquery:1 | Exit data.example.basic.allowed = _\nquery:1 Redo data.example.basic.allowed = _\nquery:1 | Redo data.example.basic.allowed = _\npolicy.rego:5 | Redo data.example.basic.allowed\npolicy.rego:6 | | Redo input.user.role = \"ADMIN\"\ntrue\nThe tracing results show that when the query was executed, it found a rule that matched the data.example.basic.allowed (which has a value whose body of the rule is true) and satisfied the sixth line role = \"ADMIN\" in the policy.rego file during the evaluation process. Matching rules are re-evaluated and the result is true.\nThis time, let's find one of the test cases where the evaluation results are false and assign input.\n> input := {\"user\":{\"role\":\"OPERATOR\",\"id\":\"oper2\"},\"api\":{\"uri\":\"/user/{user_id}/profile\",\"method\":\"PUT\"}}\nRule 'input' re-defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n> data.example.basic.allowed\nquery:1 Enter data.example.basic.allowed = _\nquery:1 | Eval data.example.basic.allowed = _\nquery:1 | Index data.example.basic.allowed matched 0 rules)\npolicy.rego:3 | Enter data.example.basic.allowed\npolicy.rego:3 | | Eval true\npolicy.rego:3 | | Exit data.example.basic.allowed\nquery:1 | Exit data.example.basic.allowed = _\nquery:1 Redo data.example.basic.allowed = _\nquery:1 | Redo data.example.basic.allowed = _\npolicy.rego:3 | Redo data.example.basic.allowed\npolicy.rego:3 | | Redo true\nfalse\nAccording to the tracing results, no rules matched and entered the line 3 of policy.rego, which is the line that assigned the default value of the rule as false. The final result is false because the line 3 is evaluated finally.\nCurrent tracing of the OPA is lengthy and difficult to grasp at a glance, but can be useful for debugging complex rules.\nScenarios with multiple API permissions\nIn the basic scenario, the API required only one permission, and the API could be called if the operator had one of the permissions in the list. Let's define a new scenario with more complexity, and assume that this time the user can have multiple permissions and that the user must have all the necessary permissions to call the API.\nFor sources related to this scenario, refer to the chap5/multipermission directory.\nData Definitions\nLet's create a new directory and create data.json with the following content:\n{\n  \"api\": {\n     \"/users/{user_id}/profile\" : {\n       \"GET\": [\"profile.read\"],\n       \"PUT\": [\"profile.read\", \"profile.update\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"operator_permission\" : {\n    \"oper1\" : [\"profile.read\",\"profile.update\"],\n    \"oper2\" : [\"profile.read\"],\n    \"oper3\" : [\"profile.update\"]\n  }\n}\n\nThe definition of a system or input schema is the same as the basic scenario, and the data schema has been changed to reflect the new requirements. The basic definition of the data schema is the same, but the required permission portion has been changed from string to string array.  An operator oper3 with profile.update privileges only is added to test cases where profile.read and profile.update were both required. Looking at the contents of the data, you can see that updating a user profile requires not only updating privileges but also reading privileges.\nIn the basic scenario, if the update permission implicitly included the read permission. But in this scenario, the read permissions and update permissions were completely separated. In some cases, it is necessary to perform only updates through APIs without having to check the existing content.  For example, if the monitoring information is updated periodically to the server, it is not necessary to pre-read the existing values. In this case, it would not be necessary to give the agent permission to read the existing monitoring information. For another example, if the existing user information is divided into details, it may be more desirable to prevent the administrator from reading the user's personal information when updating passwords, etc.\nWriting Policy\nThe package is named example.multipermission, as a scenario allows multiple permissions to be processed for API calls. The rules for checking administrator and user permissions in the basic scenario have not been changed because they do not refer to the data.api. The rules for checking operator privileges are described below. The first step is to check if the role attribute of the user is \"OPERATOR\", just like the basic scenario.  The permission list was then taken from the operationpermison object of the data using the user id as a key and assigned as a permission variable.  The required_permission variable was then assigned a list of permissions required by the API object using url and method in the api as keys.  In order to check multiple permissions, the elements in the permission array were traversed, and if the two matched against the elements in required permission, the index p of the permission array was added to the set to create a set and assigned to the satisfied_permission_idx variable.  {permission[p] | permission[p] == required_permission[]} instead of  {p | permission[p] == requiredpermission[]} allows you to create a collection of permission strings themselves, not indexes, but does not use values of the permissions themselves, so only smaller indexes are collected and created as a collection. The requiredpermission's index  indicates that it is not necessary to store that index value. The next line verifies that the number of permissions requested by api is equal to or greater than zero, because it is meaningless if both are zero, even if the number of permissions required and the number of permissions met is equal. The last line compares the number of required and satisfied permissions, which is a more efficient way to compare whether the permissions actually match each other, because the number of permissions that match the required permissions is counted.\npackage example.multipermisson\n\ndefault allowed = false\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"ADMIN\"\n}\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"USER\"\n\n  input.user.target_user_id != \"\"\n  input.user.target_user_id == input.user.id\n}\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"OPERATOR\"\n\n  permission := data.operator_permission[input.user.id]\n  required_permission := data.api[input.api.url][input.api.method]\n  satisfied_permission_idx := {p | permission[p] == required_permission[_]}\n\n  count(required_permission) > 0\n  count(satisfied_permission_idx) == count(required_permission)\n}\nTesting Policy\nSame as in the default scenario, permissions for oper1 and oper2 remain unchanged, oper1 has both read and update permissions for user profiles, and oper2 has read permissions only. When updating a user profile, both read and write permissions are required; only read permissions are required to read the profile.\nTherefore, it is still the same as the underlying scenario that operator oper1 can read and write both user profiles and oper2 can only read user profiles. So, all the test cases for the basic scenario should be met as it is. Let's copy policy_test.rego to the multipermission scenario directory, then rename the package the same as the newly created policy.rego.\nAs opposed, the newly added operator oper3 must not be able to read the user profile or update the user profile because it only has update permissions on the user profile. Let's add test cases for this.\nThe contents of the test case confirming that the operator oper3 cannot read the user profile are as follows:\ntest_oper3_profile_read_not_allowed {\n  not allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"oper3\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}/profile\",\n      \"method\" : \"GET\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe contents of the test case confirming that the operator oper3 cannot update the user profile are as follows:\ntest_oper3_profile_update_not_allowed {\n  not allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"oper3\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}/profile\",\n      \"method\" : \"PUT\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nLet's add the test case to policy_test.rego and then run the test. All newly added tests along with the existing test case can be confirmed to have been successful.\n$ opa test -v policy.rego policy_test.rego data.json\ndata.example.multipermisson.test_admin_allowed: PASS (1.0107ms)\ndata.example.multipermisson.test_oper1_profile_read_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.multipermisson.test_oper1_profile_update_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.multipermisson.test_oper2_profile_read_allowed: PASS (999.7µs)\ndata.example.multipermisson.test_oper2_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.multipermisson.test_oper3_profile_read_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.multipermisson.test_oper3_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.multipermisson.test_user_allowed: PASS (998.7µs)\ndata.example.multipermisson.test_user_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 9/9\nScenario with Public APIs\nFor the service, not only the API that is controlled by authorization but also the public API that can be called without authorization is required. Let's add a public API to the multi-permission scenario.\nFor sources related to this scenario, refer to the chap5/publicapi.\nData Definitions\nAssigning a list of required permissions to an empty array allows public APIs to be represented, so there is no need to change the data structure. The required permissions for testing added GET requests for /about URLs as follows: Let's create a directory for the public API scenario and save it as data.json.\n{\n  \"api\": {\n    \"/users/{user_id}/profile\" : {\n       \"GET\": [\"profile.read\"],\n       \"PUT\": [\"profile.read\", \"profile.update\"]\n    },\n    \"/about\" : {\n      \"GET\" : []\n    }\n  },\n  \"operator_permission\" : {\n    \"oper1\" : [\"profile.read\",\"profile.update\"],\n    \"oper2\" : [\"profile.read\"],\n    \"oper3\" : [\"profile.update\"]\n  }\n}\nWriting Policy\nFor public API scenarios, copy the policy.rego of the multi-permission scenario to the newly created directory and rename the package to example.publicapi. Public APIs are APIs with zero permissions required when importing api from data into url and method properties. If we move the rule as it is, let's add it to policy.rego.\nallowed {\n  required_permission := data.api[input.api.url][input.api.method]\n\n  count(required_permission) == 0\n}\nTesting Policy\nLet's check the test case to see if we can access the newly added API /about through the public API even if we don't have permission. Let's create a test case that fails if you check permissions as follows and change the url and method properties of api to \"/about\" and \"GET\" respectively. In this test case, users must have the same target_user_id attributes to have API permissions, but they do not have any API calling permissions because they do not have the target_user_id attribute. Therefore, it is a test case that tests whether /about can be called to GET without permission.\ntest_user_public {\n  allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"USER\",\n      \"id\" : \"user1\",\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/about\",\n      \"method\" : \"GET\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nLet's add that test case to the policy_test.rego copied from the existing multi-permission scenario, rename the package to example.publicapi, and run the test. Running the test confirms that both the existing test case and the newly added test case were successful as follows:\n$ scenario\\publicapi>opa test -v policy.rego policy_test.rego data.json\ndata.example.publicapi.test_admin_allowed: PASS (999.7µs)\ndata.example.publicapi.test_oper1_profile_read_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.publicapi.test_oper1_profile_update_allowed: PASS (1.002ms)\ndata.example.publicapi.test_oper2_profile_read_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.publicapi.test_oper2_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.publicapi.test_oper3_profile_read_not_allowed: PASS (978.7µs)\ndata.example.publicapi.test_oper3_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.publicapi.test_user_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.publicapi.test_user_not_allowed: PASS (989µs)\ndata.example.publicapi.test_user_public: PASS (0s)\nScenarios with permission hierarchy\nThis time, let's add hierarchies of permission to the scenario. For example, if you define all permissions to a user profile as a single permission, a profile, you can treat it as having both profile.read and profile.update to update the user profile. When defining permissions, it would be easier to define complex permissions if these hierarchies could be defined.\nFor sources related to this scenario, refer to the chap5/permissionhierarchy.\nData Definitions\nIn the data used in the public API scenario, oper 1 had the two permissions, profile.read and profile.update and In this scenario oper1 now have a single permission - profile. If permission hierarchy is supported, existing test cases must be successful without changing the test case.\n{\n  \"api\": {\n    \"/users/{user_id}/profile\" : {\n      \"GET\": [\"profile.read\"],\n      \"PUT\": [\"profile.read\", \"profile.update\"]\n    },\n    \"/about\" : {\n      \"GET\" : []\n    }\n  },\n  \"operator_permission\" : {\n    \"oper1\" : [\"profile\"],\n    \"oper2\" : [\"profile.read\"]\n  }\n}\nWriting Policy\nTo support the permission  hierarchy, only operator-related rules in existing scenarios were modified as follows: In previous scenarios, we simply compared the required and current permissions to the same.  The new permissionmatch rule additionally checks if the required permission starts with a string which concatenates an owned permission and the hierarchy separator(in this case dot). The reason why it does not simply compare whether it starts with ownership is because, for example, the privilege \"profiletest\" and the privilege \"profile\" do not contain each other, but meet the conditions. Therefore, if the user has the right to profile and the right to inspect is profile.read, the profile must be compared with a . separating the hierarchy to obtain accurate results. These logic works well not only in profile.read but also in multiple hierarchies such as profile.read.name.\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"OPERATOR\"\n\n  permission := data.operator_permission[input.user.id]\n  required_permission := data.api[input.api.url][input.api.method]\n  satisfied_permission := {p | permissionmatch(permission[_], required_permission[p], \".\")}\n\n  count(required_permission) > 0\n  count(satisfied_permission) == count(required_permission)\n}\n\npermissionmatch(permission, req_permission, delim) = true {\n  permission == req_permission\n} else = result {\n  result := startswith(req_permission, concat(\"\", [permission, delim]))\n}\nTesting Policy\nSince the test case has not changed, we copied it from policy_test.rego in the public API directory and changed only the package to example.permissionhierarchy. Testing confirms that all previous test cases were successful.\n$ opa test -v policy.rego policy_test.rego data.json\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_admin_allowed: PASS (971.2µs)\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_oper1_profile_read_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_oper1_profile_update_allowed: PASS (999.7µs)\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_oper2_profile_read_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_oper2_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_oper3_profile_read_not_allowed: PASS (1ms)\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_oper3_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_user_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_user_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.permissionhierarchy.test_user_public: PASS (999.9µs)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 10/10\nScenario with API hierarchy\nSupporting the API URL hierarchy as well as the permission hierarchy will make it easier to manage complex APIs. Let's define the API hierarchy to be useful for more practical applications, although it may look similar to the permission hierarchy.\nBasically,If the API URL is in the same form as /a/b/c, let's define permission on /a implicitly includes permission of /a/b or /a/b/c, and etc. This is equivalent to the hierarchical structure of the permission, except for the difference separators( . for permission and / for API). However, in some cases, a sub-API must be implicitly accessible with super-API permission  and some APIs have independent permissions regardless of the URL hierarchy.\nTo make these two applicable at the same time, /a/b, /a/b/c. a/b/c/d, etc. can all override required permissions with permissions of /a/b, if the permissions of /a are defined separately.\nThat is, if there are no directly defined permissions , follow the parent permissions; if there is a direct definition, follow the defined permission; If multiple API permission hierarchies are defined at the parent, follow the most specific parent permission . In other words, it follows the hierarchy of permission, but can be overridden at a more specific level.\nFor sources related to this scenario, refer to the  chap5/urlhierarchy.\nData definitions\nTo test the API hierarchy, we defined permissions for the /users URL, the parent URL of the existing /users/{user_id}/profile. The reason why permissions on /users are defined is to verify that permissions of /users are checked on /users requests, /users/{user_id}/profile requests are checked on /users/{user_id}/profile requests, and permissions of /users are checked on undefined /users/{user_id} reqeuests. \n{\n  \"api\": {\n    \"/users/{user_id}/profile\" : {\n      \"GET\": [\"profile.read\"],\n      \"PUT\": [\"profile.read\", \"profile.update\"]\n    },\n    \"/users\" : {\n      \"GET\": [\"user.read\"],\n      \"PUT\": [\"user.read\", \"user.update\"]\n    },\n    \"/about\" : {\n      \"GET\" : []\n    }\n  },\n  \"operator_permission\" : {\n    \"oper1\" : [\"profile\"],\n    \"oper2\" : [\"profile.read\"],\n    \"oper3\" : [\"profile.update\"],\n    \"useroper\": [\"user.read\", \"profile.read\"]\n  }\n}\n\nWring Policy\nThe policy codes that support API hierarchy are as follows: The package is named example.urlhierarchy, and administrators and users do not use API information to determine permissions, so it is the same as before.  The most important difference is that the url used to assign required_permission is not simply the url property of the api object, but the evaluation result of the longestmatchapi rule. The logestmatchapi rule finds the most specific url applicable to that url, as the name suggests. For example, to check the permissions of \"/users/{user_id}\", if the permissions for \"/users/{user_id}\" are defined, return \"/users/{user_id}\", if not, find if \"/users\" defined. In this way, we explore the url hierarchy and return the most specific url that matches. API permission checks the url and method properties together, so when checking the parent url, they actually check if the method matches.\npackage example.urlhierarchy\n\ndefault allowed = false\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"ADMIN\"\n}\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"USER\"\n\n  input.user.target_user_id != \"\"\n  input.user.target_user_id == input.user.id\n}\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"OPERATOR\"\n\n  method := input.api.method\n  url := longestmatchapi(input.api.url, method)\n\n  permission := data.operator_permission[input.user.id]\n  required_permission := data.api[url][method]\n  satisfied_permission := {p | permissionmatch(permission[_], required_permission[p], \".\")}\n\n  count(required_permission) > 0\n  count(satisfied_permission) == count(required_permission)\n}\n\nallowed {\n  method := input.api.method\n  url := longestmatchapi(input.api.url, method)\n  url\n\n  required_permission := data.api[url][method]\n\n  count(required_permission) == 0\n}\n\npermissionmatch(permission, req_permission, delim) = true {\n  permission == req_permission\n} else = result {\n  result := startswith(req_permission, concat(\"\", [permission, delim]))\n}\n\nlongestmatchapi(url, method) = apimatch {\n  urlslice := split(url, \"/\")\n  ns := numbers.range(count(urlslice),1)\n  apimatch := [api|api := concat(\"/\", array.slice(urlslice, 0, ns[_])); data.api[api][method]; api != \"\" ][0]\n}\nThe contents of the longestmatchapi rule are described below. First of all, the first line divides the string into / delimiters. Next, an array is created from the length of the previously divided array to 1 and assigned as ns. For example, if the array length is 3, it will be [3,2,1].  The last line is a bit complicated, but it is easy to understand from the concat (\"/\", array.slice (urlslice, 0, ns[]) section first. If ns is [3,2,1] due to ns[], it is repeated for concat (\"/\", array.slice (urlslice, 0, 3), concat (\"/\", array.slice (urlslice, 0, 2), concat (\"/\", array.slice (urlslslice, 0, 1). If the url argument of the rule is \"/users/{user_id}/profile\", the urlslice becomes [\"\", \"users\", \"{user_id}\", \"profile\"]. Then array.slice(0,3) becomes [\"\", \"users\", \"{user_id}\", and \"profile\". In addition, array.slice(0, 2) becomes [\"\", \"users\", \"{user_id}\"]. array.slice (urlslice, 0, 1) becomes [\"\", \"users\", \"]. When connected back to concat, it becomes \"/users/{user_id}/profile\", \"/users/{user_id}\", and \"/users\", respectively. \nThen, assign a concatenated string to an api variable, use the api and method argument to examine whether an element exists in an api object, and, if present, collect only the api variables present in an array comprehension,  then assign the first element to an apimatch.\n= apimatch part in the declaration of rules makes the apimatch variable assigned to the result of the rule.\nA closer look at the rules shows that longestmatchapi is also applied to rules declaring public APIs. A line with only url in that rule serves to check whether the result of longestmatchapi exists, not undefined. Whether to apply the API hierarchy to public APIs is a matter of choice, but in this example, we chose to apply it.\nIf you look at the logic of the longestmatchpi rule, you might think it is a little inefficient. You might think that it would be more efficient to return only one matching in the first place without storing all matching api urls in an array. In the process of writing this example, we have tried, and the for loop and break and continue statements of the traditional programming language are not supported in Rego, making it difficult to implement. I also tried this because I thought it would be possible to implement it recursively using a function, but it failed because recursions of rules are not supported in the Rego(the function is also a rule in Rego).\nIntroducing logic written in recursive form is as follows. In the case of some language, if the function is called as longestmatchapi -> longestmatchapi2 -> longestmatchapi -> … form, not recognized as recursive and allowed to be invoked in this way, depending on the language, but in the case of Rego, it was also detected as recursive. It is a code that cannot be executed, so we will not explain it in more detail, and if you are interested, please take a look.\nlongestmatchapi(url, method) = \"\" {\n  contains(url, \"/\") == false\n} else = url {\n  count(data.api[url][method]) > 0\n} else = parent_match {\n  path := split(\"/\",url)\n  num := count(path)\n  last := path[num - 1]\n\n  parent_api := trim_suffix(url, concat(\"\", [\"/\", last]) )\n\n  parent_match := longestmatchapi(parent_api, method)\n}\nIn the longestmatchpi rule, all of the url pieces that can be matched are arranged and may be considered extremely inefficient. The size of the array is equal to the size of the array divided by the / by the separator. If the URL hierarchy of the API is not too deep, it is not a serious problem for performance.  For more efficient implementation, implementing it as an OPA built-in function may be necessary, but implementing an OPA built-in function requires management of built-in functions, so we recommend implementing it only if performance is a problem.\nTesting Policy\nSince we have finished writing the policy, let's fill out the test case. Let's copy policy_test.rego from the previous scenario and rename the package to example.urlhierarchy. First, let's add the following test cases to test permissions for the newly added /users API and useroper operators.\ntest_useroper_userlist_read_allowed {\n  allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"useroper\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users\",\n      \"method\" : \"GET\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nWhen checking permissions on /users/{user_id}, the permissions of /users must be applied by exploring the API hierarchy because they are not defined in the data. Therefore, the following test cases were added to check whether permissions were allowed on /users/{user_id} as permissions were granted on /users, GET by the operator useroper:\ntest_useroper_user_read_allowed {\n  allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"useroper\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}\",\n      \"method\" : \"GET\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe operator useroper should not be allowed to attempt a PUT because it can only GET for /users and cannot do a PUT. The test cases for this are as follows.\ntest_useroper_user_update_not_allowed {\n  not allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"useroper\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}\",\n      \"method\" : \"PUT\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe operator useroper has GET access to /users, but the operator oper1 does not have permission to /users. Therefore, the operator oper1 does not have permission for /users/{user_id}. This is expressed as a test case as follows.\ntest_oper1_user_read_not_allowed {\n  not allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"oper1\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/users/{user_id}\",\n      \"method\" : \"GET\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nAccess to APIs with no API hierarchy specified in the data should not be allowed. For example, /goods has no hierarchy with APIs defined in the data. If you express this as a test case, it is as follows.\ntest_goods_not_allowed {\n  not allowed with input as {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"role\" : \"OPERATOR\",\n      \"id\" : \"oper2\"\n    },\n    \"api\": {\n      \"url\" : \"/goods\",\n      \"method\" : \"PUT\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nLet's run the whole test case. Running the test confirms that all 10 existing test cases and newly added test cases are successful.\n$ opa test -v policy.rego policy_test.rego data.json\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_admin_allowed: PASS (2.9694ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper1_profile_read_allowed: PASS (1.0002ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper1_profile_update_allowed: PASS (2.9995ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper2_profile_read_allowed: PASS (1.0251ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper2_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (1.0055ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper3_profile_read_not_allowed: PASS (1.9995ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper3_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (999.8µs)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_user_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_user_not_allowed: PASS (971.5µs)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_user_public: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_useroper_userlist_read_allowed: PASS (2.9992ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_useroper_user_read_allowed: PASS (1.0002ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_useroper_user_update_not_allowed: PASS (999.8µs)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper1_user_read_not_allowed: PASS (1.0001ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_goods_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 15/15\nSummary\nIn this chapter an API authorization scenario similar to that used in real-world development is assumed, and implements this scenario as an OPA policy. Policies were developed from the most basic scenario and multiple permission, public APIs, permission hierarchies, and API hierarchies are added. In addition, the process of progressively developing the policy and adding test cases while maintaining the tests developed in the previous phase was described step by step.\nWhile the scenarios described in this chapter may be far from the reader's actual requirements, a good understanding of these examples will greatly help to create policies through OPA, as they actually demonstrate the level of complexity and patterns required in developing applications and services.\n"},"chap6/bundle.html":{"url":"chap6/bundle.html","title":"Chap 6.

The OPA bundle includes data files in JSON or YAML format, and rego files. OPA bundles make it easier to manage multiple data and policy files packaged into a single file. Manifest can also be used to specify the root or revision of a data file and to add a signature file to ensure its validity.\nOPA Bundle Generation\nCreation of OPA bundles manually\nTo manually create an OPA bundle:\nFirst, create a directory for bundles. Let's create a directory named bundletest.\nThe data.json (or data.yaml) and each rego file must then be located in each directory. The name of the data file included in the bundle must always be data.json or data.yaml. Multiple data.json or data.yaml can exist because bundle directories can have multiple directories in their child.\nCreated test/server/rest, users, and role subdirectories under the bundletest directory.\nThen, in the test/server/rest directory, policy.rego is located, and in the users and roles directory, a data.json file containing user information and role information created respectively. The test/server/rest/policy.rego is similar to the previous policy.rego, but some changes have been made to refer to users from users/data.json as data.users.users. For the actual source files used for bundle testing, refer to the contents of the chap6/bundletest directory. \n\nchap6/bundletestopatool/test/server/rest/policy.rego\n\n\npackage test.server.rest\n\ndefault allowed = false\n\nallowed {\n    name := input.name\n    data.users.users[name].role == \"manager\"\n}\n\n\n\nThe content of users/data.json is the same as that of users.json.\n\nchap6/bundletestopatool/users/data.json\n\n\n{\n    \"users\" : {\n        \"bob\": {\n            \"role\":\"manager\"\n        },\n        \"alice\": {\n            \"role\":\"staff\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nrole/data.json is briefly written with the following:\n\nchap6/bundletestopatool/role/data.json\n\n\n{\n    \"role\" : [\"manager\", \"staff\"]\n}\n\n\n\nTo create a bundle, create a tarball (tar.gz) file as follows: The following command generates the bundle.tar.gz file, including the test, role, and users directories:\n$ tar cvzf bundle.tar.gz test role users\na test\na test/server\na test/server/rest\na test/server/rest/policy.rego\na role\na role/data.json\na users\na users/data.json\nIf bundle.tar.gz is created, let's load it from OPA and check it out. Instead of specifying the policy and data files individually, you can specify bundle.tar.gz when issuing OPA commands as follows: You can check the loaded content by outputting the result loaded with the data command.\n$ opa run bundle.tar.gz\nOPA 0.23.2 (commit 661ec2f, built at 2020-08-24T18:49:53Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands and check for updates.\n\n> data\n{\n  \"role\": {\n    \"role\": [\n      \"manager\",\n      \"staff\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"test\": {\n    \"server\": {\n      \"rest\": {\n        \"allowed\": false\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"users\": {\n    \"users\": {\n      \"alice\": {\n        \"role\": \"staff\"\n      },\n      \"bob\": {\n        \"role\": \"manager\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nIf you look at the loaded content, you can see that users.role and others are added to the hierarchy. For example, in the previous example, information from a user named Alice could be accessed as data.users[alice] but after inclusion in the bundle, it should be accessed using data.users.users[alice]. If you want to access data.users[\"alice\"] as before, you can place data.json or data.yaml directly in the bundle top-level directory so that hierarchies are not included.\nBundle may contain manifest files. The manifest file is named .manifest and is a JSON file in the following format: revision refers to a revision number that can distinguish bundles, either by the commit ID of the git repository or by the version given by the organization's policy. roots specifies the root directory of the package to be exposed externally. The default value for roots is [“\"], which includes all directory structures in the bundle and does not have packages imported from outside. If there is a package imported from outside the bundle (such as HTTP), it must be declared in the root for additional packages to be used.\n{\n  \"revision\" : \"6973caed1c345856387b5476d562897356dbe056\",\n  \"roots\": [“test”, \"roles\", “users“]\n}\nTo add a manifest, you can include .manifest in the list of files in the tar command.\n$ tar cvzf bundle.tar.gz test role users .manifest\na test\na test/server\na test/server/rest\na test/server/rest/policy.rego\na role\na role/data.json\na users\na users/data.json\na .manifest\nOPA Bundle Tools\nThe OPA bundle generation tool provided by OPA makes it easier to generate bundles. However, the bundle generated by the OPA is provided with all the data combined and flattened into one file optimized for minimal traffic use.\nTo generate an OPA bundle, run the following command from the bundle's top-level directory: For the actual source files used for bundle testing, refer to the contents of the chap6/bundletestopatool directory.\n$ opa build .\nThe command was executed with only the test, role, and users directories present, not including .manifest.\nEven if the manifest file exists in that directory, it is not included in the generated bundle. To include revisions and others in manifest, it must be passed to the arguments of the bundle tool.\nThe bundle file name generated by executing the command above is bundle.tar.gz. First, let's create a temp directory, copy bundle.tar.gz, and release the tarball.\n$ tar xvzf bundle.tar.gz\ntar: Removing leading '/' from member names\nx data.json\nx test\\\\server\\\\rest\\\\policy.rego\nx .manifest\nThe data files in the role and users directories were merged to include a single data.json file, and the policy.rego file remained in place.\nFirst of all, if you check the manifest generated by the bundled tool, it is as follows. No revision or package root was specified as an argument, indicating that the manifest created with default values.\n{\"revision\":\"\",\"roots\":[\"\"]}\nIf you look at the generated data.json, you can see that role/data.json and users/data.json have been merged to remove spaces.\n{\"role\":{\"role\":[\"manager\",\"staff\"]},\"users\":{\"users\":{\"alice\":{\"role\":\"staff\"},\"bob\":{\"role\":\"manager\"}}}}\nThe contents of the test/server/rest/policy.rego file inside the bundle were included in the bundle without significant changes:\npackage test.server.rest\n\ndefault allowed = false\n\nallowed {\n  name := input.name\n  data.users.users[name].role == \"manager\"\n}\nThe generated bundle is loaded with the opa run bundle.tar.gz command and tested to work the same as the manually created bundle.\nSigning OPA Bundle\nOPA supports HMAC, RSA and ECSDA for bundle signatures. The HMAC method is to verify the integrity of messages with hash values by sharing the same secret code for signature and verification. On the other hand, RSA and ECSDA use a public key encryption method to sign and verify with a private key. Let's use each method to sign the bundle and verify the signed bundle when loading it.\nBundle Signing and Verification with HMAC\nTo sign a bundle with HMAC, specify the HMAC-related signature algorithm such as HS256, HS384, HS512 in the singing-alg argument as the following command when creating the bundle, and enter the code to be used as a password in the signing-key. When signing a bundle, you should specify the --bundle argument rather than the target directory immediately. See the contents of the chap6/bundlehmac directory for the actual source files used for bundle testing.\n$ opa build --signing-alg HS512 --signing-key secret --bundle .\nHS256, HS384, and HS512 are algorithms to be used for HMAC signatures, and the larger the number, the stronger the security and makes the signature larger. Codes specified by signing-key shall use the same code when verifying the signature.\nCopy the generated bundle file (bundle.tar.gz) to the directory you created temporarily, and then extract it. When extracted, the signature is recorded differently from the existing bundle.You can see the addition of .signatures.json.\n$ tar xvzf bundle.tar.gz\ntar: Removing leading `/' from member names\nx data.json\nx test\\\\server\\\\rest\\\\policy.rego\nx .manifest\nx .signatures.json\nThe format of the .signature file is as follows: It has a string array value for a key called signatures, which can now contain only one signature in the file, so the array is always 1 in size. The signature value is a string in typical JWT format.\n{\n  \"signatures\": [\n    \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsImtpZCI6ImRlZmF1bHQifQ.eyJmaWxlcyI6W3sibmFtZSI6InRlc3Qvc2VydmVyL3Jlc3QvcG9saWN5LnJlZ28iLCJoYXNoIjoiYzVkNTM3MTg1NjBiNWYyMWE3ZDYwZjhkY2YyNzNmZTJkZjQ3YWYwNDdiMjRmYzNhZWQ4NzAzYWJlMDY1MDQxMiIsImFsZ29yaXRobSI6IlNIQS0yNTYifSx7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXRhLmpzb24iLCJoYXNoIjoiY2RmNjcxYzYwOTg2NDdlMWYxYTIxYTI1YTMzZmJkODQwNDNiNmJmZTIyODEyYTQyYmRiOGIyNWEyM2EwYWZhNCIsImFsZ29yaXRobSI6IlNIQS0yNTYifSx7Im5hbWUiOiIubWFuaWZlc3QiLCJoYXNoIjoiZDIwYTE4NTJjMTk1OGE0NDE5OGZhNmM5MDJjOWM5ZjNhNWJmMTZjNTY2MjVlZDVmN2EyMDQ0ODg4NjM3YjgxNiIsImFsZ29yaXRobSI6IlNIQS0yNTYifV0sImtleWlkIjoiZGVmYXVsdCJ9.yLpCjF0JCL7MsX3N8tEoYqMagL5HlpYG0o2mvbj0X5cwmXKAJLMTQl0w3HdimuheEWo7tOKA8Fwrc5jFujE-wA\"\n  ]\n}\n\nTo verify this signature, you can access jwt.io and select the signature algorithm in the debugger as shown in Figure 6-1, enter the contents of the signature in the Encoded section, and enter the secret you specified by code in the Verification of Signature section. The .singnature.json itself, which contains the signature file without the code, is a jwt file, so you can see the content, but you need the code to verify that the content has not changed since signing.\nTo verify the generated bundle, you can load it with the following command: The signing-alg argument can specify the same algorithm used for signing, and the run command takes over the signature code as the verification-key factor. Finally, if you do not specify the --bundle (or –b) option, you load the bundle without verifying the signature, so if you want to verify it, you must specify the --bundle option.\n$ opa run --signing-alg HS512 --verification-key secret --bundle bundle.tar.gz\nIf the code for signature verification or signature algorithm is specified differently than when it is signed, the signature verification fails and the bundle does not load as follows:\n$ opa run --signing-alg HS512 --verification-key nosecret --bundle bundle.tar.gz\nerror: load error: bundle bundle.tar.gz: Failed to verify message: failed to match hmac signature\n \nFigure 6-1. Verification of bundle signatures signed with HS512\nBundle signature and verification using asymmetric key signatures\nThe basic behavior is the same as HMAC-based bundle signing and verification, except for algorithms that specify that private keys and public keys are used for signing and validation instead of the same signature code for signing and validation. It is recommended to use a version later than 0.25 because the bundle verification function using asymmetric key signatures does not work with bugs until version 0.24. For your information, the bug was found by the author while testing the book and reported to the https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2796 issue. Readers are also encouraged to actively report on github issues if there is a function that does not work as expected among OPA functions.\nFirst, let's test RSA algorithm-based bundle signing and verification.\nPrior to the test, the public and private keys shall be generated using openssl. openssl will be installed by default in Linux or Mac OS environments. In a Windows environment, you can install the Git client for Windows and run the openssl command by utilizing the included gitbash. Let's first run the next openssl command to create it.\n$ openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048\n$ openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem -pubout\nThe first command generates an RSA private key named private_key.pem with a size of 2048 bits. The second command generates a public_key.pem matching the private_key.pem.\nWhen the public key and private key are generated, let's sign the bundle using the private key private_key.pem. As previously discussed, only the signing-alg and signing-key arguments need to be replaced and the private_key.pem and public_key.pem can be located in the bundled directory to generate signatures for those key files, so keep them in a different directory for reference. See the contents of the Chap6/bundlersa directory for the actual source files used for bundle testing.\n$ opa build --signing-alg RS512 —signing-key ../private_key.pem --bundle .\nWhen the bundle is generated, copy the bundle file to the directory you created temporarily and extract it with the tar xvzf bundle.tar.gz command. The JWT token contains .signing.json's contents, and if the contents of the file to be included in the bundle have not been modified, the header of the JWT and the last signature are different, but the data (or payload) containing the hash values of the file is the same as before.\nTo verify the bundle, you can only change the signing-alg and verification-key to verify it in the same way as before.\n$ opa run --signing-alg RS512 —verification-key ../public_key.pem --bundle bundle.tar.gz\nLet's then sign and validate the ECSDA algorithm-based bundle. In the case of ECSDA algorithms, the signature and verification methods are similar. However, there is a difference in how keys are generated. The following command was used to create a public key ecpublic_key.pem that matches the private key ecprivate_key.pem.\n$ openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ecprivate_key.pem\n$ openssl ec -in ecprivate_key.pem -pubout –out ecpublic_key.pem\nWhile RSA keys set the number of bits at generation, the ECSDA algorithm sets the kind of elliptical curve to use. In the example above, prime256v1 is used, and the types of elliptical curves available can be determined by the command: The Go-based library used by the OPA does not support all elliptical curves, so if the key does not work, please recreate it with prime256v1 and confirm.\n$ openssl ecparam –list_curves\nsecp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field\nsecp112r2 : SECG curve over a 112 bit prime field\nsecp128r1 : SECG curve over a 128 bit prime field\nsecp128r2 : SECG curve over a 128 bit prime field\n... (omitted) ...\nbrainpoolP512r1: RFC 5639 curve over a 512 bit prime field\nbrainpoolP512t1: RFC 5639 curve over a 512 bit prime field\nSM2 : SM2 curve over a 256 bit prime field\nTo verify your signature on jwt.io, simply enter the contents of private_key.pem where you entered the code before, as shown in Figure 6-2.\nTo generate a signed bundle based on an ECDSA, you can run the following command: From the previous commands, we can see that only the signing-alg and signing-key arguments are different. For the actual source files used for bundle testing, refer to the contents of the chap6/bundlecdsa directory.\n$ opa build --signing-alg ES512 --signing-key ../ecprivate_key.pem --bundle .\n \nFigure 6-2. Verification of bundle signatures signed with RS512\nTo load a bundle signed with ECDSA, you can run the following command:\n$ opa run --signing-alg ES512 —verification-key ../ecpublic_key.pem --bundle bundle.tar.gz\nCreating Bundle Signature File Only\nOnly .signatures files can be created using the opa sign command. If only .signatures files are created separately and included in the tarball creation, the bundle generated by the tar cvzf command can also be signed. If you want to create a signature file only, you can change the opa command to sign instead of build as follows:\n$ opa sign --signing-alg ES512 --signing-key ../ecprivate_key.pem --bundle .\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we examined the generation and signature of OPA bundles, and how to verify them. OPA bundles make it easy to package and manage files consisting of multiple data and policies, and manage version information of bundles through metadata. Signatures also allow us to verify that policies or data have not been tampered with fraudulently.\nIn the next chapter, we discuss how to integrate OPA with other components of the system in various forms, and in this process, how to periodically poll and update bundles on separate remote servers.\n"},"chap7/integrations.html":{"url":"chap7/integrations.html","title":"Chap 7.

A comparison of the different integration choices for OPA4\n4 (Source: https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/#comparison)\nThis chapter discusses how to utilize the REST API and how to utilize the Go client library. Web assemblies are described separately in a later chapter.\nOPA REST API Server\nThe OPA REST API server is developed in the Go language. And all tools provided by OPA including REPL, REST API server, and bundle generation tools, are available in a single binary of opa or opa.exe, depending on the platform.\nThe simplest way to run an OPA REST server is as follows.\n$opa run –s \nLet's test the OPA REST API server by generating simple rules and data. Let's test the OPA REST API server by generating simple rules and data. Briefly describe the contents of policy.rego, assign the name field of the input JSON object to the name variable, and then import the object whose key is the value of the name variable from the data.users object. True is assigned to allowed if the role field of the object is equal to the string \"manager\". If the role field is different from \"manager\", the value of allowed is the default value false.\npackage test.server.rest\n\ndefault allowed = false\n\nallowed {\n    name := input.name\n    data.users[name].role == \"manager\"  \n}\nLet's create a data file that stores the data.users values. Then save the contents as users.json.\n{\n    \"users\" : {\n        \"bob\": {\n            \"role\":\"manager\"\n        },\n        \"alice\": {\n            \"role\":\"staff\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nTo verify that the stored data is loaded normally, you can run the opa run command to output the data as follows: If the data file is written properly, the contents are printed as follows:\n$ opa run policy.rego users.json\nOPA 0.23.2 (commit 661ec2f, built at 2020-08-24T18:49:53Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands and check for updates.\n\n> data\n{\n  \"test\": {\n    \"server\": {\n      \"rest\": {\n        \"allowed\": false\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"users\": {\n    \"alice\": {\n      \"role\": \"staff\"\n    },\n    \"bob\": {\n      \"role\": \"manager\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nTo see if policy.rego works properly, let's assign an object with the name field \"bob\" to input as follows: After allocating input, you can see that the data.test.server.rest.allowed has been changed to true.\n> input := {\"name\":\"bob\"}\nRule 'input' defined in package repl. Type 'show' to see rules.\n> data.test.server.rest.allowed\ntrue\nIf both data and policy files are ready, add the –s option to the opa run command to float the REST API server.\n$ opa run -s policy.rego users.json\n{\"addrs\":[\":8181\"],\"diagnostic-addrs\":[],\"insecure_addr\":\"\",\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Initializing server.\",\"time\":\"2020-10-07T22:07:37+09:00\"}\nSince the OPA server started with 8181 ports, let's run the query using a browser as shown in Figure 7-1. You can access the OPA server by typing localhost:8181 as a URL in the browser window (if localhost does not work, you can access it at 127.0.0.1:8181). Let's enter {\"name\":\"bob\"} assigned by REPL in the Input Data section and allowed = data.test.server.rest.allowed in the Query section. Unlike Repl, the result value must be assigned to the variable to be included in the result object, and the result is the same even if the allocation speaker := is used instead of =.\nAfter input is entered, click the [Submit] button to see the result value in the result field of the JSON object.\n \nFigure 7-1. Connecting to the OPA server from a web browser\nThis time, let's request a query with the REST API on the OPA server using curl. The same result can be obtained by executing the command.\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed –d {\\\"input\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"bob\\\"}}\n{\"result\":true}\nIn order to pass the input object to the curl, the input objects can be saved to a file if the escaping is uncomfortable or the input objects are too large. Let's save the following as input.json and call the API in the same curl.\n{\"input\":{\"name\":\"bob\"}}\nTo call a curl with contents of a file as input stream, you can specify the –d factor in the form @  as follows: The execution results are the same as when the JSON object is passed into the input.\n$ curl -d @input.json localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed\n{\"result\":true}\nRunning an OPA server with HTTPS\nIn most cases, the OPA server will run on the internal network within the firewall. In recent micro-service environments, security is often applied between services in internal networks, and HTTPS must be applied unconditionally if it is required to be disclosed to external networks. In the future, HTTPS application to API servers is essential because regular HTTP connections will not be available in web browsers at all. For sources related to HTTPS applications, see chap7/https.\nHTTPS application requires a TLS certificate. HTTPS validates TLS certificates through the Certificate Authority (CA). It is convenient to use a self-signed certificate signed with a private key in a test environment, because a typical TLS certificate may require the cost of issuing the certificate and an internet connection to the certificate authority. However, it should be noted that using self-signed certificates for commercial services can lead users to misunderstand that they are required to accept unverified certificates unconditionally, and that commercial services should not use self-signed certificates because browsers show warning messages. Let's use self-signed certificates for testing purposes only.\nFirst of all, let's issue a self-signed certificate as follows. The following openssl genrsa command generated a private key with a size of 2048 bits to sign the certificate: Private keys are generated randomly, so deleting and re-generating them produces keys with different values. After the key was generated, the certificate was generated, and the expiration date was set to 10 years (3650 days) for readers to use the source provided by the book. When generating the certificate, many questions were asked, but the country was set to KR, the common name was set to localhost, and the remaining fields were left blank. The generic name of the credential is typically set to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), which most specifically represents the host address, and the email of the certificate manager is set together.\n$ openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048\nGenerating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus (2 primes)\n.............................................................+++++\n.................................................................................................+++++\ne is 65537 (0x010001)\n\n$ openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key private.key -out public.crt -days 3650\n... (ellipsis) ...\n-----\nCountry Name (2 letter code) [AU]:KR\nState or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:\nLocality Name (eg, city) []:\nOrganization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:\nOrganizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:\nCommon Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:localhost\nEmail Address []:\nWhen you start the server using the issued certificate, you can specify the certificate file and the private key file used to generate the certificate in the tls-cert-file and tls-private-key-file arguments as follows: Even if the certificate is issued and used by an authorized certificate authority, only the process of issuing it is different, but the key file and the certificate file used to generate the certificate are specified.\n$ opa run -s --tls-cert-file public.crt --tls-private-key-file private.key policy.rego users.json\n{\"addrs\":[\":8181\"],\"diagnostic-addrs\":[],\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Initializing server.\",\"time\":\"2021-01-30T22:20:21+09:00\"}\nLet's open another shell, change the curl request address from localhost to https://localhost, and send the request to the server. Contrary to expectations, an error complaining a self-signed certificate will occur.\n$ curl -d @input.json https://localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed\ncurl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate\nMore details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html\n\ncurl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not\nestablish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and\nhow to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.\nIn HTTPS operation, the operating system or browser basically has a list of top certification authorities (Symantec, Digicert, etc.) and it trusts only the certification authorities or certificates signed by them. Because a self-signed certificate is a certificate signed with a randomly generated key, curl et al. cannot verify them by default. Therefore, self-signed certificates can encrypt communications, but they cannot verify the identity of the certificates used for communications. Therefore, if it is not clear that the certificate file is provided by a trusted target, it should not be allowed recklessly, but it can be used for testing purposes.\nThe –k option (long as the --insecure option) for curl allows access to HTTPS even if the certificate is not verifiable. Certificates from authorized certification bodies are verifiable and do not require the –k option. If you add the –k option to the curl, you will see the following results:\n$ curl -k -d @input.json https://localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed\n{\"result\":true}\nConfigure OPA REST API Server\nStructure of the OPA Configfile\nOPA config files can be written in JSON or YAML, and YAML provides better readability. The OPA config file has the following structure: The services section first contains connection information when external HTTP services need to be accessed for bundle polling, etc. in OPA. The example declares a service called example, URL http://localhost:8080/policy/v1, and the timeout waiting for a response is 5 seconds. While the services section seems to declare which ports OPA services will use, the ports that OPA servers will use can only be set by an argument when running operrun –s, and the services declared in the services section define endpoints for the bundled servers or the state servers that update the OPA server status.\nThe labels section is used to label the OPA server for management. In the labels section, you can define the desired label, and the contents of the label are included in the policy evaluation result log or status information. Therefore, recording information on the operating environment, development environment, and management department using labels will greatly help analyze logs and status information in the future, and if there are multiple servers, information on servers related to each other can be filtered through labels.\nThe bundle section contains settings for updating policies and data of the OPA server by polling bundles in external services. In the example, we declared a bundle called example, which downloads a resource called bundle/example/bundle.tar.gz of the example service. The URL to be actually polled is http://localhost:8080/policy/v1/bundles/example/bundle.tar.gz, which combines the URL of the service and the path of the resource. The polling cycle is at least 60 seconds and up to 120 seconds, and the bundle is polled and updated once every 60 to 120 seconds.\nThe persist sets whether to store the polling bundle on disk, and unless the storage location is set separately, it is stored in the bundles directory under the .opa directory where the OPA server was executed. If the signature contains a signature from the bundle downloaded from the remote service, you can specify a key to verify the signature. The verification key is defined in the keys section and may refer to the corresponding key in the keys section as the key_id. In the keys section, a public key to be used to verify the bundle can be defined. In this example, the algorithm was set to RS512 because the bundle signed with the RS512 algorithm was used, and the contents of the previously generated public_key.pem were opened and copied with a text editor. To specify a string consisting of multiple lines in YAML as a value, write | (a character used as an OR or Unix pipe symbol in a programming language) to recognize the value from the next line to the front of the blank line.\nservices:\n  example:\n    url: http://localhost:8080/policy/v1\n    response_header_timeout_seconds: 5\n\nlables:\n  region: prod\n  depart: dev1\n  service: example\n\nbundles:\n  example:\n    service: example\n    resource: bundles/example/bundle.tar.gz\n    persist: true\n    polling:\n      min_delay_seconds: 60\n      max_delay_seconds: 120\n    signing:\n      keyid: example_key\n\nkeys:\n  example_key:\n    algorithm: RS512\n    key: |\n      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n      MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxtXx9HIydGa90/0SIlyi\n      G6uJS3xTZqr+IfIA1YZrgdhpIJSIW4Wj19R56X6tzr5AMw4Z/FfcR7E+5/9Q30y9\n      8bvCDMM+58RPIhL4fyHLZeLR2ysMHgXt3aQ1epTKJA+AP2ndQu7nzYJ/ZgIzQkGO\n      3AR9IfYva5D9x9d5KxsBS6S5FyAfT9zspWtN9OO2Vu8jH9G/vWnLagYD8hXfTiaa\n      U+ujkB0OSlOOWDVbXPO0Aw/z7GKyc9Zg/TF2Vq8/SJjw0j1FlgJCC+tXBx8SYXuQ\n      TxsjpMHAGiWg5slt+FpvSQEcZjPlvUN+tnvsUxfnVpyMDmxKMvdRtzAy0BaL/wpe\n      GQIDAQAB\n      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n\ndecision_logs:\n  console: true\n\ncaching:\n  inter_query_builtin_cache:\n    max_size_bytes: 10000000\nThe decision_logs section sets the contents of the OPA's policy evaluation result log. The log may be transmitted to a remote server defined in the service, or the policy result log may be output to the console. Here, logs are set to be output to the console.\nIn addition, there is a status section that sets the state of the OPA server to be transmitted to an external server, and a discovery section that integrates external bundles, policy decision logs, and status servers to dynamically find them.\nApply configurations when starting REST server\nTo specify the OPA configuration file (opaconf.yaml in this example) when starting the REST server, use the –c option to run as follows.\n$ opa run –s –c opaconf.yaml\nCurrently, opaconf.yaml receives bundles from http://localhost:8080/policy/v1, so if executed as above, an error occurs because the bundle cannot be found. Let's set aside the HTTP server that provides the bundle and try to polling the bundle periodically through the REST API. A server that serves bundles can be easily started with a simple command. Python 3.x is used to execute the command, so Python must be installed first, and Python installation is simple, so it is not covered in this book.\nFirst, in order to ensure that the bundle is located in the policy/v1 path, a path is created so that the v1 directory is located under the policy directory. If you are using a window cmd shell, it is easy to create a directory at once using the “mkdir -p policy\\v1” command, and in Linux or MacOS, use the “mkdir -p policy/v1”. After the directory is created, do not move it, but copy the bundle to use under that policy/v1 directory. In this book, bundle signed RS512 was used for opaconf.yaml, so bundle.tar.gz signed RS512 was copied. When you finish copying, let's do it as follows.\n$ python3 -m http.server --bind localhost 8080 --directory .\nServing HTTP on ::1 port 8080 (http://[::1]:8080/) ...\nIf it works properly, the policy directory looks at the top when accessed by browser as shown in Figure 7-2. Let's click on the policy directory and v1 directory one by one to see if a bundle file exists.\n \nFigure 7-2. Accessing the Bundle Server using Web browser\nFor simplicity, we started the bundle server as it was guided on the OPA usage page, but when applied in production, it is recommended to configure web servers such as Apache and nginx or to develop and use simple web servers in programming languages such as node.js.\nIf the bundle server works well, let's launch the OPA server as follows. It can be seen that the OPA server starts and bundles are periodically polled.\n$ opa run -s -c opaconf.yaml\n{\"addrs\":[\":8181\"],\"diagnostic-addrs\":[],\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Initializing server.\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T10:19:10+09:00\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Starting bundle downloader.\",\"name\":\"example\",\"plugin\":\"bundle\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T10:19:10+09:00\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Starting decision logger.\",\"plugin\":\"decision_logs\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T10:19:10+09:00\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Log upload skipped.\",\"plugin\":\"decision_logs\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T10:19:10+09:00\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Bundle downloaded and activated successfully.\",\"name\":\"example\",\"plugin\":\"bundle\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T10:19:10+09:00\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Bundle downloaded and activated successfully.\",\"name\":\"example\",\"plugin\":\"bundle\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T10:21:08+09:00\"}\n...\nLet's open another shell and send the request to the OPA server in curl. The request is the same as the request sent earlier in this chapter.\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed -d {\\\"input\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"bob\\\"}}\n{\"decision_id\":\"f7b082e5-16b5-4368-bae3-6752ebf4179a\",\"result\":true}\nAs a response, we can see that the result:true has been returned the same as before, and that the decision_id has been returned together in the form of uuid.\nIf you look at the shell that started the OPA server, you can see that the following contents have been output.\n{\"client_addr\":\"[::1]:61080\",\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Received request.\",\"req_id\":1,\"req_method\":\"POST\",\"req_path\":\"/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T10:34:01+09:00\"}\n{\"client_addr\":\"[::1]:61080\",\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Sent response.\",\"req_id\":1,\"req_method\":\"POST\",\"req_path\":\"/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed\",\"resp_bytes\":68,\"resp_duration\":8.0402,\"resp_status\":200,\"time\":\"2020-11-05T10:34:01+09:00\"}\nWe briefly checked how to set up the OPA server. For more information on settings, see the official document at https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/configuration/).\nRun OPA server in Docker and Kubernetes Environment\nOPA provides an official docker image, so you can easily float the OPA server using docker or Kubernetes. If you search for openpolicyagent/opa in the docker hub, you can find the OPA docker image as shown in Figure 7-3. If you check the description of the OPA official docker image, the images shown in Table 7-2 are provided.  In the development process, openpolicy agent/opa:latest-debug with a built-in shell for debugging can be used. openpolicyagent/opa:latest-rootless can be used rather than openpolicyagent/opa:latest for application in the production environment. However, it is better to use a rootless image that operates as a server with an account other than root because security check tools can complain of it as a security vulnerability.\n \nFigure 7-3. OPA docker image (hub.docker.com/r/openpolicyagent/opa)\n\n\n\nImage Tag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nopenpolicyagent/opa:\nThe standard OPA image\n\n\nopenpolicyagent/opa:-debug\nIncludes a shell and is based on the lightweight distroless images\n\n\nopenpolicyagent/opa:-rootless\nSets the USER to a non-root value\n\n\nopenpolicyagent/opa:-static\nContains a statically linked OPA executable\n\n\nopenpolicyagent/opa:-envoy\nInclude an Envoy External Authorization server\n\n\n\nTable 7-2. Types of OPA docker images provided through docker hubs. (source: https://hub.docker.com/r/openpolicyagent/opa)\nRun in a Docker Environment.\nAlthough it is simple to execute OPA through dockers, it is necessary to consider ways to deliver policies and data so that OPA containers can recognize them. The easiest way is to connect the local directory to the container and then allow the OPA container to load the file.\nDocker installation is required first to run the OPA server on the docker. To use docker, you can install the docker desktop in the Windows or Mac OS environment, and the docker engine package in the Linux environment. Hyper-V must be enabled to install docker desktops in a Windows environment, but unless it is the latest update of Windows 10, Hyper-V is not enabled in the Home version and the docker desktop is not available. If you are a Windows 10 Home version user, let's update to the latest build. This book will not cover detailed docker installation instructions, so see https://www.docker.com/get-started.\nLet's run OPA on docker. For related sources, refer to the chap7/docker directory. First of all, the directory (c:\\opabook\\chap7\\docker\\rest in this example) containing the two files, which is policy.rego and users.json, was mounted on /rest of the container, and ran the container using openpolicyagent/opa:late-rootless image. In addition, run/rest/policy.rego/rest/users.json was handed over as an argument in the image, and the standard input/output of the container was connected to the shell with the –it option. When the container is executed, you can see the same OPA shell as when the OPA is directly executed as a binary as follows.\n$ docker run -it –v c:\\opabook\\chap7\\docker\\rest:/rest openpolicyagent/opa:latest run /rest/policy.rego /rest/users.json\nOPA 0.23.2 (commit 661ec2f, built at 2020-08-24T18:49:17Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands and check for updates.\n>\n\nEnter the data command and the result will be output if the file is loaded normally. If you enter Ctrl + D to terminate the shell, you can see the following prompt, and pressing y ends the process.\n\nDo you want to exit ([y]/n)? y\nLet's run the OPA container with the REST API server. The OPA server may be started by running with open-s  in the same manner as when running with binary. When running with REST API, the –p option must be added to expose the port of the container to the outside, and the –it option is not required because it is in server mode. The results of applying all of these contents are as follows.\n$ docker run –p 8100:8181 -v c:\\opabook\\chap7\\docker\\rest:/rest  openpolicyagent/opa:latest-rootless run -s /rest/policy.rego /rest/users.json\n{\"addrs\":[\":8181\"],\"diagnostic-addrs\":[],\"insecure_addr\":\"\",\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Initializing server.\",\"time\":\"2020-10-11T11:52:20Z\"}\nIn the above example, the 8181 port was mapped to the 8000 port of the host in the container. When tested with curl as follows, the same results as when the server was run with binary without container will be returned.\n$ curl localhost:8000/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed -d {\\\"input\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"bob\\\"}}\n{\"result\":true}\nEven if you enter Ctrl + C from the shell connected to the OPA server container and get out of the shell, it will still work well if you request the same in curl again because it was operated in daemon mode with the opa run -s command.\nTo shut down the running server, you can check the running container with the docker ps command as follows, stop the container with the docker stop, and delete the container with the docker rm command. In the example below, 8dc8394f6058 is a container identifier and is a randomly generated value, so it depends on the environment. Therefore, when you execute, the container identifier that is handed over to the docker stop or docker rm must be changed according to the container identifier output as a result of the docker ps command.\n$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES\n8dc8394f6058        openpolicyagent/opa:latest-rootless   \"/opa run -s /rest/p…\"   9 minutes ago       Up 9 minutes        0.0.0.0:8000->8181/tcp   thirsty_bartik\n\n$ docker stop 8dc8394f6058\n8dc8394f6058\n\n$ docker rm 8dc8394f6058\n8dc8394f6058\nBy executing the docker ps command again, it can be confirmed that the container has been deleted. Following the example, if the port is already occupied, it is highly likely that another container was previously started on the same port, so let's check with the docker ps command.\n$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\nRun in a Kubernetes Environment\nIn a Kubernetes environment, it is more convenient to set policies and data files to be imported through bundles rather than copied and connected to volumes. This book briefly explains how to operate an OPA server in a Kubernetes environment. For related sources, refer to the chap7/kubernetes directory.\nIn the previous example, the bundle server was started by binding to the localhost address, and the bundle server's binding address should be specified as an IP that can be routed from the pods in the Kubernetes. If you test on a PC, you can specify the IP returned with the ifconfig (Linux or MacOS) or ipconfig (Window) command, and if you test on an external server, check the IP address of the server operating the bundle server. In the case of the author, since it is a PC connected through an Internet router and the IP of the PC is 192.168.0.10, the bundle server was executed as follows. To verify that the specified IP is correct, enter it in the form of http://192.168.0.10:8080 to access it. (It needs to be changed to suit the IP of the PC you use)\n$ python3 -m http.server --bind 192.168.0.10 8080 --directory .\nIf the bundle server works well, try running the OPA server in Kubernetes with the kubectl command. First, a namespace that can separate and manage resources related to the OPA server is created under the name opa.\n$ kubectl create namespace opa\nOnce the namespace is created, copy the opaconf.yaml used in the previous example and replace the IP with the bundle server IP.\nservices:\n  example:\n    url: http://192.168.0.10:8080/policy/v1\n    response_header_timeout_seconds: 5\n....\nThen create a configmap named opaconf so that opaconf.yaml can be used in Kubernetis. In this case, the previously created namespace is designated with the –n option.\n$ kubectl -n opa create configmap opaconf --from-file opaconf.yaml\nTo ensure that the configmap is properly created, try executing the following command.\n$ kubectl –n opa describe configmap opaconf\nName:         opaconf\nNamespace:    opa\nLabels:       \nAnnotations:  \n\nData\n====\nopaconf.yaml:\n----\nservices:\n  example:\n    url: http://localhost:8080/policy/v1\n    response_header_timeout_seconds: 5\n...\nIf a configmap has been created, a service for the OPA server must be created. Write and save the following contents under the name of service.yaml. In this book, services were exposed through Cluster IP, but if there is a load balancer available in Kubernetis, it is better to expose the service port with Load Balancer.\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: opa\n  labels:\n    app: opa\nspec:\n  type: ClusterIP\n  selector:\n    app: opa\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      protocol: TCP\n      port: 8181\n      targetPort: 8181\nYou can create a service by executing the following command.\n$ kubectl –n opa apply –f service.yaml\nLet's check if the service is well created with the following command.\n$ kubectl -n opa get svc\nNAME   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\nopa    ClusterIP   10.107.90.72           8181/TCP   15s\nWhen a service is created, a deployment for the OPA server container must be created. Write the following and save it as deployment.yaml.\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: opa\n  labels:\n    app: opa\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: opa\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: opa\n      name: opa\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: opa\n        image: openpolicyagent/opa:latest\n        ports:\n        - name: http\n          containerPort: 8181\n        args:\n        - \"run\"\n        - \"--ignore=.*\"\n        - \"-s\"\n        - \"-c\"\n        - \"/opaconf/opaconf.yaml\"\n        volumeMounts:\n        - readOnly: true\n          mountPath: /opaconf\n          name: opaconf\n      volumes:\n      - name: opaconf\n        configMap:\n          name: opaconf\nYou can create an OPA deployment by executing the following command.\n$ kubectl –n opa apply –f deployment.yaml\nOnce the deployment is created, check with the following command to see if a pod containing a container has been properly created in Kubernetes.\n$ kubectl -n opa get pod\nNAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nopa-d78bf44fc-5t9nv   1/1     Running   0          15m\nThe log can be checked with the kubectl logs command using the pod name that appears as a result of the kubectl get pod command. If the server operates normally, a log similar to the previous example will appear.\n$ kubectl -n opa logs opa-d78bf44fc-5t9nv\n{\"addrs\":[\":8181\"],\"diagnostic-addrs\":[],\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Initializing server.\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T12:36:21Z\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Starting bundle downloader.\",\"name\":\"example\",\"plugin\":\"bundle\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T12:36:21Z\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Starting decision logger.\",\"plugin\":\"decision_logs\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T12:36:21Z\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Log upload skipped.\",\"plugin\":\"decision_logs\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T12:36:21Z\"}\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Bundle downloaded and activated successfully.\",\"name\":\"example\",\"plugin\":\"bundle\",\"time\":\"2020-11-05T12:36:21Z\"}\nCurrently, the service exposes the port to Cluster IP, so it cannot be accessed from outside Kubernetes from the OPA server. Let's perform port forwarding in the opa service with the next command.\n$ kubectl -n opa port-forward service/opa 8181:8181\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:8181 -> 8181\nForwarding from [::1]:8181 -> 8181\nLet's open another shell and test it with curl to see if the service works well. It can be seen that it works well.\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed -d {\\\"input\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"bob\\\"}}\n{\"decision_id\":\"bfa3be4a-66d8-4c5b-bd38-444bd99b34f0\",\"result\":true}\nOnce the test is complete, enter Ctrl+C on the shell running the kubectl port-forward to stop port forwarding, and delete the generated kubernetes resources using the following commands. If all commands have been successfully completed, all resources generated by Kubernetis during the test process will be deleted. If an error occurs on the way, correct the problem, delete the resources, and retest.\n$ kubectl –n opa delete deployment opa\ndeployment.apps \"opa\" deleted\n\n$ kubectl –n opa delete service opa\nservice \"opa\" deleted\n\n$ kubectl –n opa delete configmap opaconf\nconfigmap \"opaconf\" deleted\n\n$ kubectl delete namespace opa\nnamespace \"opa\" deleted\nIntegrate OPA into the Application with the Go Client Libraries\nThis time, let's run OPA using the Go client library. First of all, the Go compiler should be installed, and it is recommended to install the version above 1.13 as much as possible. Go compilers can download the latest versions for each platform by accessing https://golang.org/dl.\nFirst, let's create a directory to use as a project. After creating the opa_go_hello directory, the opa_go file was created with the following contents using an editor.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    input := map[string]interface{}{\n        \"name\": \"bob\",\n    }\n\n    opaFiles := []string{\n        \"policy.rego\",\n        \"users.json\",\n    }\n\n    queryStr := \"data.test.server.rest.allowed\"\n\n    r := rego.New(\n        rego.Query(queryStr),\n        rego.Load(opaFiles, nil),\n    )\n\n    ctx := context.Background()\n\n    query, err := r.PrepareForEval(ctx)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"unable to prepare for eval: %s\", err)\n    }\n\n    rs, err := query.Eval(ctx, rego.EvalInput(input))\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"unable to eval: %s\", err)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"rs = %+v\\n\", rs)\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"query result = %+v\\n\", rs[0].Expressions[0].String())\n}\nThe contents of the code are as follows. First, \"context\", \"fmt\", and \"log\" are modules basically provided in the Go language. Then, the OPA module \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego\" was imported.\nInput variables were declared and assigned as a map, and the key type of the map is string and the value type of the map is interface{}  (which can indicate any type of variable similar to Java's object type or C/C++'s void*). The Go language basically provides a module for JSON parsing, which returns to the map [string] interface{} when unmarshalling the JSON. That is, the input variable contains the value obtained by unmarshalling the input.json of the previous example. Similarly, oppaFiles is an array of strings containing policies and data file paths to load. Finally, the queryStr variable is a string containing a query to be requested from the OPA.\nThen call rego.New to initialize the rego, which passes the query string to rego.Query to generate a query and loads the policy and data files using rego.Load. The second argument of rego.Load is a filtering function that can only filter functions that satisfy conditions such as specific extensions in the file list, and in this example, filtering is not required, so it has passed nil. For how to use functions such as rego.New, refer to the godoc page about opa modules, https://godoc.org/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego.\nNext, the context is created, and if settings such as timeout are not required, create a basic context using context.Background(). Pass the context created by the initialized Rego engine and complete preparations for evaluation are completed.\nFinally, the evaluation is performed, the result is assigned to the rs variable, and then call fmt.Printf to format and output the results. The printf's %+v indicator is an indicator that cannot be seen in the printf series of rough numbers in other languages, with %v outputting in a format suitable for each type, and %+v outputting structures including field names.\nOnce the code has been written, let's run it. Before executing the code, the OPA module must be installed, and it can be managed as project dependency through the go module, or it can be installed locally through the go get command.\nAfter saving the source, the go module is initialized by executing the following command.\n$ go mod init example.com/opahello\nAfter the module is initialized, the result can be confirmed by executing it as follows. If there is an error, let's check the code again.\n$ go run opahello.go\nrs = [{Expressions:[true] Bindings:map[]}]\nquery result = true\nIf you look at the execution results, the results are included in the Expressions section. Bindings is the part where the variable name is the key if a variable to contain the query result is specified, such as when accessing the OPA server through the web. Let's change the query in the source code from \"data.test.server.rest.allowed\" to \"x = data.server.rest.allowed\" and try again. It may be seen that the value of key x is set to true in the Bindings map.\n$ go run opahello.go\nrs = [{Expressions:[true] Bindings:map[x:true]}]\nquery result = true\nIt is recommended that managing dependencies with the go module that the code to be applied in the production environment. However, if it is simply for test purposes, it would be more convenient to install a library locally. If you want to install it without managing it as a go module, let's install it as follows with go get.\n$ go get –u github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego\nAfter installing the library, let's run it with the following command. The execution result is the same as the case of applying the go module.\n$ go run opahello.go\nrs = [{Expressions:[true] Bindings:map[x:true]}]\nquery result = true\nHow to integrate OPA with external data.\nThe official OPA documentation presents five ways to integrate OPA with external data as shown in the following table. Let's look at each method.\n\n\n\nApproach\nPerf/Avail\nLimitations\nRecommended Data\n\n\n\n\nJWT\nHigh\nUpdates only when user logs back in\nUser attributes\n\n\nInput\nHigh\nCoupling between service and OPA\nLocal, dynamic\n\n\nBundle\nHigh\nUpdates to policy/data at the same time.

No size limit\nDynamic or large\n\n\n\nTable 7-3. Comparison by Method Integrating External Data to OPA 5\n5 Source: https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/external-data/\nJWT-based Method\nThis is a method of passing JWT tokens to one field of input delivered to OPA. After verifying and decoding the signature of the JWT token passed by input used as basic data for policy evaluation. The JWT token described in the chapter related to the builtin function and the builtin function for verification may be called and implemented in the Rego file.\nInput Overloading\nThis is a method of handing over the data necessary for policy making to the fields of the input. Assuming that the information that can be obtained from JWT is handed over to Input overloading, it may be possible to perform decoding of JWT tokens in the application code before handing them over to OPA. Among the decoded information, only information necessary for policy and authority judgment can be added to Input and handed over, and this method of adding necessary information to Input and handing it over as a field is called Input Overloading. It is a method used in integration through the Go client library.\nBundle\nIt is a method of bundling data and policies to be used and periodically polling bundles in an OPA server. The integration method through bundles has already been dealt with in the OPA server configuration section.\nPush\nWhenever external data changes, changes are pushed to the OPA server using the API provided by the OPA server. The OPA server updates the contents of the pushed portion of the data. Let's briefly find out how to push data to the server using the API of the OPA server.\nFirst of all, let's open the shell and start the OPA server without any data or policy as the following command.\n$ opa run –s\n{\"addrs\":[\":8181\"],\"diagnostic-addrs\":[],\"insecure_addr\":\"\",\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Initializing server.\",\"time\":\"2020-11-09T22:01:42+09:00\"}\nWhen you open another shell and get the data with curl, the empty object is returned as the result without any data as follows.\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data\n{\"result\":{}}\nIf JSON is passed through PUT to the sub-URL of /v1/data of the OPA server, the entire object will be updated if it exists, and if it does not exist, it will be newly created.\n$ curl -X PUT localhost:8181/v1/data/test/push -d {\\\"key1\\\":\\\"val1\\\",\\\"key2\\\":\\\"val2\\\"}\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data\n{\"result\":{\"test\":{\"push\":{\"key1\":\"val1\",\"key2\":\"val2\"}}}}\nIf you want to modify only a part of the data, you can use PATCH. The content to be patched in the OPA is not a general JSON, but a JSON Patch format defined as RFC 6902.\nFirst, let's create a JSON file in JSON Patch format and save it as patch.json.\n[ { \"op\":\"replace\", \"path\":\"/key1\", \"value\":\"newval1\" } ]\nThe top end of the JSON patch document is an array of objects, and each object has an op specifying an action to be performed, a path specifying a path to a key on the document, and a value field specifying a value. Each field is not explained in detail, and readers who want more information will be able to understand easily by referring to https://docs.microsoft.com/ko-kr/aspnet/core/web-api/jsonpatch?view=aspnetcore-3.1.\nIf you have written patch.json, call the API to PATCH and change the value of key1 as follows.\n$ curl -X PATCH localhost:8181/v1/data/test/push -d @patch.json\nIf you look up the data again after calling the API, you can see that the value has changed well.\n$ curl -X GET localhost:8181/v1/data/test/push\n{\"result\":{\"key1\":\"newval1\",\"key2\":\"val2\"}}\nEvaluation Pull\nThis is a method of importing external data each time a policy is evaluated using built-in functions that can invoke the HTTP API within the rego code defining the OPA policy. This is an applicable method if the data is too large to load at once or if dynamically changing data must always be reflected up to date.\nPerformance can be reduced because it uses built-in functions inside the policy code to call HTTP every time, but memory usage decreases because it allows you to read the latest data at the moment of calling HTTP every time and does not continue to store and recycle what you read. Built-in function http.Send can be called within the Rego file to import external data into HTTP.\nManage Policy using a Database\nOPA does not directly provide the ability to store and read data from a database. Let's think about how to link OPA to the database.\nAmong the five OPA external data integration methods discussed earlier, JWT and input overloading are about input rather than data, and input is not suitable for integration with the database because it is closer to session information than data read from the database.\nExamples of the available methods are as follows.\n1)  A method of generating a bundle by reading data from a database\nThe necessary databases may be periodically batch-processed, or a database change may be detected, a data file may be generated, a bundle may be created, and provided to HTTP. In this case, it is recommended to re-download the bundle only if the change occurs using a version and timestamp to confirm the change in the data. By changing the configuration file of the OPA server, it is possible to periodically check and download the bundle.\n2) A method using push\nWhenever a database is updated in a policy management service, the HTTP API provided by the OPA server is used to push it to the OPA server. The OPA server provides an API that faithfully follows the REST style, and when an API using the PUT method is applied, it creates new data if there is no existing data, and overwrites it with new content. The PATCH operates differently from the PUT and changes only a specified portion of the data.\n3) A method using poll\nThe method of developing and operating a service that inquires policies stored in a database into HTTP APIs and calling APIs from a rego file within an OPA server as an HTTP-related embedded function can always reflect the latest data stored in the database.\nSummary\nThis chapter examines various methods for integrating OPA with other components of the system or external systems. It explained how to integrate OPA into an application written in Go as a client library and how to use OPA as a separate REST server. In addition, a method of packaging policies and data in bundles and a method of sharing data with the outside while preventing modulation through signature and verification of bundles were also presented with examples. Finally, various methods applicable to integrating policy data into external data in the OPA server were also discussed. Through the contents of this chapter, readers will be able to sketch how to integrate OPA with systems that are actually being developed/operated.\n"},"chap8/monitoring.html":{"url":"chap8/monitoring.html","title":"Chap 8.

The OPA server was asked for a request including a query in which the request was successful, a query in which the request failed, and the request with invalid parameters using the following command. For reference, /v1/compile is an API that returns a simplified policy by partial evaluation when a Rego file is POSTed, and if the content to be POST is empty, a invalid parameter error occurs.\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed -d {\\\"input\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"bob\\\"}}\n{\"result\":true}\n\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed/aaa -d {\\\"input\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"bob\\\"}}\n{\n\"code\": \"internal_error\",\n\"message\": \"1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_type_error: undefined ref: data.test.server.rest.allowed.aaa\\n\\tdata.test.server.rest.allowed.aaa\\n\\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\thave: boolean\"\n}\n\n$ curl -i -X POST localhost:8181/v1/compile\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nDate: Thu, 04 Feb 2021 06:25:25 GMT\nContent-Length: 96\n\n{\n\"code\": \"invalid_parameter\",\n\"message\": \"error(s) occurred while decoding request: EOF\"\n}\nIf you request localhost:8181/metrics again, you can see that items for HTTP requests have been added for each API and error code as follows. http_request_duration_seconds is a histogram type, indicating how the request response time is distributed by interval (le=\"0.005\" which is within 0.005 seconds, that is, within 5 ms, and le=\"0.01\" which is within 10 ms...).

Logs must be checked to confirm the results of these policy evaluations.\nMonitoring using Prometheus\nPrometheus allows you to collect and monitor metrics in the above form when you request the /metrics URL.\nLet's install Prometheus and monitor the OPA server. To install Prometheus, you must access https://prometheus.io/download/ and download Prometheus as shown in Figure 8-1. Choose the right version for the platform you use and download it.\n \nFigure 8-1. Prometheus download page\nDownload Prometheus and extract it, and you can see the following list.\nLICENSE\nNOTICE\nconsole_libraries\nconsoles\nprometheus\nprometheus.yml\npromtool\nThe configuration file of Prometheus is prometheus.yml, and the contents are as follows. Basically, Prometheus itself provides the same /metrics API as the monitoring target and operates at 9090 ports. Therefore, the content of the scrape_config section is monitoring the prometheus itself.\nglobal:\n  scrape_interval: 15s\n  evaluation_interval: 15s\nalerting:\n  alertmanagers:\n  - static_configs:\n    - targets:\n      # - alertmanager:9093\n\nrule_files:\n  # - \"first_rules.yml\"\n  # - \"second_rules.yml\"\n\nscrape_configs:\n  - job_name: 'prometheus’\n    static_configs:\n    - targets: ['localhost:9090']\nTo add monitoring for OPA, set job_name to opa and target address to OPA server address localhost:8181 in the same form under the prometheus section of the scrap_configs section. The modified content may be found in the source file Chap8/prometheus/prometheus.yml.\nscrape_configs:\n  - job_name: 'prometheus’\n    static_configs:\n    - targets: ['localhost:9090']\n  - job_name: 'opa’\n    static_configs:\n    - targets: ['localhost:8181']\nPrometheus can be started by executing the following command.\n$ ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml\nAfter Prometheus started, enter localhost:9090 in your browser to access Prometheus.\n \nFigure 8-2. Prometheus start page\nTo check whether the registered OPA-related metrics are being collected well, click the Status -> Targets menu to see the screen shown in Figure 8-3. If registered normally, the status of the oppa target is UP\n \nFigure 8-3. Prometheus OPA target\nIf you click the Graph menu again, leave your cursor in the Metrics Search window, and press the spacebar to enter a space, you can see the list of available metrics as shown as Figure 8-4.\n \nFigure 8-4. Check the list of metrics available in Prometheus\nLet's choose go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes, which represents the amount of currently allocated memory in bytes. After selection, click the Execute button to see the current measured value as shown in Figure 8-5. Both Prometheus and OPA provide the corresponding metric, so two results are shown. If you want to view only the contents related to opa, you can apply a filter like go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"opa\"}.\n \nFigure 8-5. go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes metrics\nIf you click the Graph tab and adjust the time interval to [+], [-], you can see the change in metric as shown in Figure 8-6.\n \nFigure 8-6. Graph of go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes metric\nPrometheus stores metric values collected in a time series database, so monitoring data while the Prometheus server operates and the OPA server operates to provide metrics is not lost. If performance degradation of OPA servers occurs, checking various metrics at the time of degradation will greatly help identify problems.\nLet's graph the average response time associated with HTTP requests. In order to stack data to draw graphs, randomly irregular numbers of curl requests were repeatedly sent to the server.\nPrometheus provides a dedicated query language called PromQL, which is used to create a query that obtains request response time at 1-minute intervals as follows.\navg(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[1m]) / rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[1m])) by (code, handler, instance, method)\nVisualizing this as a graph is shown in Figure 8-7.\n \nFigure 8-7. Http mean response time graph visualized by Prometheus\nMonitoring Single Query Performance\nWhen an API is requested, the OPA server provides performance information for the corresponding request along with the result if it is an API that can be provided as a metric. If you need such metric information, you can cross metrics=true as the HTTP query parameter of the request. When metrics=true is exceeded, the response returns an object containing metric values to the metrics field together.\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed?metrics=true -d {\\\"input\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"bob\\\"}}\n{\"metrics\":{\"counter_server_query_cache_hit\":0,\"timer_rego_external_resolve_ns\":0,\"timer_rego_input_parse_ns\":0,\"timer_rego_query_compile_ns\":0,\"timer_rego_query_eval_ns\":0,\"timer_rego_query_parse_ns\":0,\"timer_server_handler_ns\":0},\"result\":true}\nHealth Check of OPA Server\nThe OPA server provides an API for health check. Health check is mainly used for the purpose of checking the status of a service on a Kubernetes or proxy server rather than calling the API directly.\nIf you request the /health URL from the OPA server, it returns HTTP response code 200 OK if it works normally, and if there is a problem, it returns 500 Internal Server Error. While the OPA server is operating, you can check it as follows using curl. If the status is 200 OK, nothing is output as the curl default option, so the –i option was added to check the response code.\n$ curl –i localhost:8181/health\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nDate: Wed, 03 Feb 2021 05:38:05 GMT\nContent-Length: 2\nIn addition to /health, which can check the status of the server itself, OPA can also check the status of bundles or plugins using  /health?bundles and  /health?plugins.\n$ curl -i localhost:8181/health?bundles\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nDate: Wed, 03 Feb 2021 05:57:03 GMT\nContent-Length: 2\n\n{}\n\n$ curl -i localhost:8181/health?plugins\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nDate: Wed, 03 Feb 2021 05:57:10 GMT\nContent-Length: 2\n\n{}\nThe  /health?bundles or  /health?plugins returns 200 OK only when all bundles or all plug-ins are operating normally. It is not possible to check which of the several plugins or bundles is not operating normally by health check. This information should be utilized by the /status API, which does not call from the client to the GET, but acts by POSTing JSON to the /status URL of the server.\nIn addition, in the case of bundles, failure of subsequent updates once all bundles are loaded does not affect health checks. This is because if the bundle update fails, the OPA server is not unavailable, and the service is available in the existing state.\nOPA Server Status and Decision Log\nThe OPA status information and decision log operate in a different way than the Prometheus metric and health check that return information in response to a GET call. When enabled in the OPA setting on the designated server, the content is POSTed to the /status URL and /log URL of the remote server or output to the console in the form of JSON. In a Kubernetes environment, content output in JSON form from the OPA container to the console can be processed by collecting them into the EFK (ElasticSearch + Fluentd + Kibana) stack.\nOPA Server Status\nStart the web server for bundle with the following command in the chap8/statusandlog directory of the source code. For reference, bundles in the policy directory are the same as those used in Chapter 7.\n$ python3 -m http.server --bind localhost 8080 --directory .\nThe OPA configuration file used in chapter 7 is modified as follows. The modified part is the status and division_logs section, and adding the console: true part will output the log to the window where the OPA server is started.\nservices:\n  example:\n    url: http://localhost:8080/policy/v1\n    response_header_timeout_seconds: 5\n\nlabels:\n  region: prod\n  depart: dev1\n  service: example\n\nbundles:\n  example:\n    service: example\n    resource: bundles/example/bundle.tar.gz\n    persist: true\n    polling:\n      min_delay_seconds: 60\n      max_delay_seconds: 120\n    signing:\n      keyid: global_key\n\nkeys:\n  global_key:\n    algorithm: RS512\n    key: |\n      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n      MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxtXx9HIydGa90/0SIlyi\n      G6uJS3xTZqr+IfIA1YZrgdhpIJSIW4Wj19R56X6tzr5AMw4Z/FfcR7E+5/9Q30y9\n      8bvCDMM+58RPIhL4fyHLZeLR2ysMHgXt3aQ1epTKJA+AP2ndQu7nzYJ/ZgIzQkGO\n      3AR9IfYva5D9x9d5KxsBS6S5FyAfT9zspWtN9OO2Vu8jH9G/vWnLagYD8hXfTiaa\n      U+ujkB0OSlOOWDVbXPO0Aw/z7GKyc9Zg/TF2Vq8/SJjw0j1FlgJCC+tXBx8SYXuQ\n      TxsjpMHAGiWg5slt+FpvSQEcZjPlvUN+tnvsUxfnVpyMDmxKMvdRtzAy0BaL/wpe\n      GQIDAQAB\n      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n\ndecision_logs:\n  console: true\nstatus:\n  console: true\nLet's run the following command to start the OPA server.\n$ opa run –s –c opaconf_console.yaml\nWhen the server starts, several logs are output, and the status log part is as follows. The OPA log is not formatted and spaces are removed, so each JSON object is output one line at a time, but the [Format Document] function was executed and sorted in VsCode to make it easier for users to see.\n{\n    \"bundles\": {\n        \"example\": {\n            \"last_request\": \"2021-02-04T14:48:10.1058913Z\",\n            \"last_successful_activation\": \"2021-02-04T14:48:10.1089159Z\",\n            \"last_successful_download\": \"2021-02-04T14:48:10.1058913Z\",\n            \"last_successful_request\": \"2021-02-04T14:48:10.1058913Z\",\n            \"metrics\": {\n                \"timer_rego_data_parse_ns\": 0,\n                \"timer_rego_load_bundles_ns\": 5000900,\n                \"timer_rego_module_compile_ns\": 0,\n                \"timer_rego_module_parse_ns\": 0\n            },\n            \"name\": \"example\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"labels\": {\n        \"id\": \"8a3cf7d6-5123-44ad-87dd-c38f749f6ed7\",\n        \"version\": \"0.26.0\"\n    },\n    \"level\": \"info\",\n    \"metrics\": {\n        \"prometheus\": {\n...\n            \"go_threads\": {\n                \"help\": \"Number of OS threads created.\",\n                \"metric\": [\n                    {\n                        \"gauge\": {\n                            \"value\": 11\n                        }\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"name\": \"go_threads\",\n                \"type\": 1\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"msg\": \"Status Log\",\n    \"plugins\": {\n        \"bundle\": {\n            \"state\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        \"decision_logs\": {\n            \"state\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        \"discovery\": {\n            \"state\": \"OK\"\n        },\n        \"status\": {\n            \"state\": \"OK\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"time\": \"2021-02-04T23:48:10+09:00\",\n    \"type\": \"openpolicyagent.org/status\"\n}\nA brief description of the status log is as follows. First, since the msg field is \"Status Log\", it may be seen that it is in a state log. Through the labels section, you can know the OPA version and the unique ID of the server.\nThe bundle field includes information such as the time when the bundle was attempted to be downloaded from the remote bundle server, the last successfully downloaded time, and various processing times for loading from the OPA. Through this content, it is possible to determine whether there was any problem with periodically updating the policy bundle remotely. If the local bundle file was loaded by a factor without downloading it from a remote server, the bundle will not be updated periodically, so the bundle field is not included in the status log.\nIn the metrics field, there is a prometheus object, and the metric for prometheus is converted into JSON format as it is and included.\nIn the plugins field, the status of each plug-in is displayed per plug-in. Plugins are activated according to configurations, but because external URLs are defined as services, discovery plugins are activated and bundles are activated because remote bundles are configured. In addition, status and decision_logs were also activated because state information and decision logs were activated, respectively. In the health check, only the normal operation of the entire plug-in was known, but the operation status of the individual plug-in can be checked through the plugins field.\nOPA Decision Log\nThe decision log is output when a query is requested from the OPA server. With the server running for the previous section, let's send a request to the OPA server as follows. When the decision log is activated, the response includes a decision_id field.\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data/test/server/rest/allowed -d {\\\"input\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"bob\\\"}}\n{\"decision_id\":\"fae26b4e-2563-43ae-bc50-cb518d0b22a8\",\"result\":true}\nWhen you look at the terminal where the OPA server is started, the decision log is output. It is output in one line without a space in JSON, and it is as follows to make it easy to see.\n{\n  \"bundles\": {\n    \"example\": {}\n  },\n  \"decision_id\": \"0fd4ad8c-8bfb-4335-b48c-18b73e87e9b3\",\n  \"input\": {\n    \"name\": \"bob\"\n  },\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"id\": \"8a3cf7d6-5123-44ad-87dd-c38f749f6ed7\",\n    \"version\": \"0.26.0\"\n  },\n  \"level\": \"info\",\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"counter_server_query_cache_hit\": 0,\n    \"timer_rego_external_resolve_ns\": 0,\n    \"timer_rego_input_parse_ns\": 792000,\n    \"timer_rego_query_compile_ns\": 0,\n    \"timer_rego_query_eval_ns\": 0,\n    \"timer_rego_query_parse_ns\": 0,\n    \"timer_server_handler_ns\": 792000\n  },\n  \"msg\": \"Decision Log\",\n  \"path\": \"test/server/rest/allowed\",\n  \"requested_by\": \"[::1]:63766\",\n  \"result\": true,\n  \"time\": \"2021-02-05T00:51:10+09:00\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-02-04T15:51:10.0038784Z\",\n  \"type\": \"openpolicyagent.org/decision_logs\"\n}\nLooking at the log, it can be seen that the msg field is \"Decision Log\". The labels field includes ID and version information that were output as status information when the OPA server was started. The metrics field contains performance information when processing the query. In addition, the path, input, and result fields each include the requested query, input, result, etc.\nMasking Decision Log\nAs discussed above, since the content of the input remains in the input field in the decision log, masking of the field may be necessary depending on the situation.\nTo mask the OPA decision log, mask rules must be defined in the system.log package. Examples of mask rules are as follows.\npackage system.log\n\n# If the name field of input is bob, remove the salary field\nmask[\"/input/salary\"] {\n  input.input.name == \"bob\"\n}\n\n# Remove input's password field\nmask[\"/input/password\"]\n\n# If a card field exists in input, change the value to ****-****-****-****\nmask[{\"op\": \"upsert\", \"path\": \"/input/card\", \"value\": x}] {\n  input.input.card\n  x := \"****-****-****-****\"\n}\nThe mask rule was defined as a partial rule. Values between [] in which the rule satisfies the condition are gathered into a set and become an output variable of the mask rule. It will be easy to understand if you refer back to the partial rule section of Chapter 3.\nThere is something noticeable in the content of the rule, which is a comparison of values with input.input.name rather than input.name. When log masking is operated, input is not an input of the OPA query, but a decision log object itself, so the input field of the decision log becomes an actual query input. Therefore, the input of the query is input.input within the system.log.\nThe contents are as follows. First, if the name field of the query input is bob, /input/salary is added to the mask output variable set. That is, if there is a salary field under the input object, it is deleted. The next rule is unconditionally true without a rule body, so /input/password is unconditionally added to the output variable. The last rule uses JSON patch grammar to replace the card field of the input with the value of the x variable assigned by the rule, if the card field is defined in the input (that is, if not undefined). \nLet's save the rules and test them. The following command was executed to start the server.\n$ opa run -s --set decision_logs.console=true mask.rego\nSince only masking will be tested, only mask.rego was simply loaded without loading the bundle from the server. The --set option designated decision_logs.console=true, which has the same effect as loading the OPA configuration file in which only the console in the decision_logs section is set to true.\nIn addition to input.name in the input, let's add more fields to manipulate in the masking example and send a request to the OPA server using curl. The result of the response is empty because /v1/data was requested without a query and only masking rules were loaded without loading the policy when executing the server.\n$ curl localhost:8181/v1/data -d {\\\"input\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"bob\\\",\\\"salary\\\":12000,\\\"password\\\":\\\"1234\\\",\\\"card\\\":\\\"1234-1234-1234\\\"}}\n{\"decision_id\":\"276778f8-ae0a-4a3f-8940-deac56ff7995\",\"result\":{}}\nThe contents are as follows if the decision logs output on the OPA server are easily sorted to find and match the decision_id of the response.\n{\n  \"decision_id\": \"276778f8-ae0a-4a3f-8940-deac56ff7995\",\n  \"erased\": [\n    \"/input/password\",\n    \"/input/salary\"\n  ],\n  \"input\": {\n    \"card\": \"****-****-****-****\",\n    \"name\": \"bob\"\n  },\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"id\": \"c652d5f4-e8fa-4825-a237-4cbae2a39ec4\",\n    \"version\": \"0.26.0\"\n  },\n  \"level\": \"info\",\n  \"masked\": [\n    \"/input/card\"\n  ],\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"counter_server_query_cache_hit\": 0,\n    \"timer_rego_external_resolve_ns\": 0,\n    \"timer_rego_input_parse_ns\": 0,\n    \"timer_rego_query_compile_ns\": 0,\n    \"timer_rego_query_eval_ns\": 0,\n    \"timer_rego_query_parse_ns\": 0,\n    \"timer_server_handler_ns\": 0\n  },\n  \"msg\": \"Decision Log\",\n  \"requested_by\": \"[::1]:59487\",\n  \"result\": {},\n  \"time\": \"2021-02-06T01:55:03+09:00\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-02-05T16:55:03.3773544Z\",\n  \"type\": \"openpolicyagent.org/decision_logs\"\n}\nAccording to the results, the card attribute of the input field was changed to ---, and the password and salary attributes were deleted from the input field. In addition, it can be seen that the path of the deleted attributes is added to the erased field.\nIt works well if you load the locally loaded bundle and the masking policy together, but it does not work if you load the local masking policy with the remotely downloaded bundle. In this case, a masking policy must be included when generating a bundle.\n\nImplementing a Server to Collect Status Information and Decision Logs\nThe OPA status information is delivered in such a way that the uncompressed JSON document is POSTed to the URL/status, and the decision log is a JSON document is POSTed to the URL/logs, but is compressed and delivered to GZIP. Let's implement a server that simply outputs the received status information and decision logs on the screen. Implementation in the Go language is as follows. Since it is a standard HTTP request, no matter what language it is implemented in, it will work well if it is accurately processed by URL, method, and GZIP compression.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"compress/gzip\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"io/ioutil\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc status(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    if r.Method != \"POST\" {\n        http.Error(w, \"Unsupported Method.\", http.StatusNotFound)\n        return\n    }\n\n    body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Println(\">***** Status Start *****\")\n    fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\", body)\n    fmt.Println(\"***** DecisionLog Start *****\")\n    fmt.Printf(\"%s\\n\", body)\n    fmt.Println(\"Unlike the examples in the previous chapter, only the basic library provided by the Go language is used, so compilation and execution are possible without performing module setup tasks such as go mod init. The go run command allows you to execute it immediately without having to compile it separately.\n$ go run logandstatus.go\nLet's test if the log is delivered to a separate server. First, the OPA configuration file is modified as follows.\nservices:\n  example:\n    url: http://localhost:8080/policy/v1\n    response_header_timeout_seconds: 5\n  statusandlog:\n    url: http://localhost:9111\n    response_header_timeout_seconds: 5\n\nlabels:\n  region: prod\n  depart: dev1\n  service: example\n\nbundles:\n  example:\n    service: example\n    resource: bundles/example/bundle.tar.gz\n    persist: true\n    polling:\n      min_delay_seconds: 60\n      max_delay_seconds: 120\n    signing:\n      keyid: global_key\n\nkeys:\n  global_key:\n    algorithm: RS512\n    key: |\n      -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n      MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxtXx9HIydGa90/0SIlyi\n      G6uJS3xTZqr+IfIA1YZrgdhpIJSIW4Wj19R56X6tzr5AMw4Z/FfcR7E+5/9Q30y9\n      8bvCDMM+58RPIhL4fyHLZeLR2ysMHgXt3aQ1epTKJA+AP2ndQu7nzYJ/ZgIzQkGO\n      3AR9IfYva5D9x9d5KxsBS6S5FyAfT9zspWtN9OO2Vu8jH9G/vWnLagYD8hXfTiaa\n      U+ujkB0OSlOOWDVbXPO0Aw/z7GKyc9Zg/TF2Vq8/SJjw0j1FlgJCC+tXBx8SYXuQ\n      TxsjpMHAGiWg5slt+FpvSQEcZjPlvUN+tnvsUxfnVpyMDmxKMvdRtzAy0BaL/wpe\n      GQIDAQAB\n      -----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n\ndecision_logs:\n  service: statusandlog\n  reporting:\n    min_delay_seconds: 5\n    max_delay_seconds: 10\n\nstatus:\n  service: statusandlog\nLooking at the contents of the modified file, the address of the server to which the status information and decision log will be delivered is registered as a service. In addition, it may be confirmed that the service fields in the description_logs and status sections are set to corresponding services.\nWith the bundle server and the Go program in operation, start the OPA server with the newly created opaconf_remote.yaml as follows.\n$ opa run –s –c opaconf_remote.yaml\nWhen the state information is transmitted to the remote server and printed in the console, and when a request is sent to curl, a decision log will also be printed in the console. The detailed process is repeated and thus omitted.\nSet up Partition for the Status Information and Decision Log \nWhen sending status information and decision logs to a remote server, if a partition is set, it can be set to POST with /status/ and /logs/ instead of POST with /status, /logs. This function allows you to separate and manage logs collected from different servers.\nTo set up a partition, you can set the desired partitionn_name at the bottom of the division_logs section and status section in the OPA configuration file, respectively. When you set up a partition, you have to modify the Go program that you printed after receiving status information and decision logs, but it's not that difficult, so you leave it to the readers.\ndecision_logs:\n  service: statusandlog\n  partition_name: example\n  reporting:\n    min_delay_seconds: 5\n    max_delay_seconds: 10\n\nstatus:\n  service: statusandlog\n  partition_name: example\nSummary\nChapter 8 explains the contents of monitoring the resource usage of the OPA server, checking query execution performance, checking health, remote delivery of status information and decision logs. Contents related to monitoring and logging of these OPA servers will be of great help in operating the OPA server.\nChapter 9 is not much related to the contents of Chapter 8, but we look at how to apply OPA as Kubernetis' policy engine that many readers will be interested in.\n"},"chap9/kubernetes.html":{"url":"chap9/kubernetes.html","title":"Chap 9.

Chapter 7 has already looked at how to operate the OPA server in a Kubernetes environment, but what we looked at earlier is not for Kubernetis' policy management, but for application policy management.\nOPA has explained that it is useful for authorization and policy management for microservice environments and cloud-native environments (which can be regarded as a Kubernetes  environment). This chapter describes OPA gatekeepers that enable OPA to be used for managing Kubernetes policies required in CI/CD pipelines and DevOps environments.\nOPA Gatekeeper\nOPA Gatekeeper Overview\nThe OPA gatekeeper serves as the final gateway to auditing whether Kubernetes API requests comply with policies defined by OPA immediately before they are reflected in the actual system after completing Kubernetes self-certification and authorization. As shown in Figure 9-1, the OPA gatekeeper implements Kubernetes' admission webhook controller to intervene whenever changes to resources occur in Kubernetes.\n \nFigure 9-1. Interaction between OPA gatekeeper and Kubernetes 6\n6 (Source: https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/08/06/opa-gatekeeper-policy-and-governance-for-kubernetes/)\nThe current version of the OPA gatekeeper was first developed as v3.x, and the 1.x version was used to write and reflect the Rego file as a configmap, but in v3.x, it was changed to a method using CRD (Custom Resource Definition). Policies used by OPA gatekeepers are implemented as CRDs that define custom resources (CRs), customized resource types other than basic resources such as services and distribution of Kubernetes. Kubernetes CR, defined by OPA, is a constraint template and a constraint instantiated by setting arguments in that template for reuse of policies. Constraint templates contain Rego policies, and constraint instances are created by substituting arguments in the constraint template, and multiple instances with arguments factors may be created from one template.\nThe OPA gatekeeper is a separate project from the OPA and has been implemented in the Go language. OPA's Github repository is https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa and OPA gatekeeper's Github repository is https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper, which is different from each other. Documents on the OPA gatekeeper can be referred to through https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs, a different web page from the OPA official document.\nInstallation and Removal of OPA Gatekeeper\nCluster-admin permission is required to install the OPA gatekeeper. If you use Minikube or docker desktop on a PC, there is no problem because all permissions are basically allowed. If you do not have administrative permissions in the actual service environment, you should contact the administrator. This book assumes that readers use Minikube or docker desktops.\nTo install the OPA gatekeeper, you can execute the kubectl command as follows. The post-execution warning message tells you to use v1 because the version of some installed components is v1beta1, which will not be supported in the future, and if no other errors occur, there is no problem with the operation. If the Kubernetes version is too up-to-date, the range of operable Kubernetes versions will narrow, so it seems that the OPA gateway project itself is maintaining the previous version. The OPA gatekeeper version at the time of writing this book is 3.3, and if an error occurs when readers run, apply the latest version of the OPA gatekeeper. If you want to check the latest version, you can check https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/releases.\n$ kubectl apply –f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/release-3.3/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml\n\nnamespace/gatekeeper-system created\nWarning: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1 CustomResourceDefinition is deprecated in v1.16+, unavailable in v1.22+; use apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 CustomResourceDefinition\ncustomresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/configs.config.gatekeeper.sh created\ncustomresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/constraintpodstatuses.status.gatekeeper.sh created\ncustomresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/constrainttemplatepodstatuses.status.gatekeeper.sh created\ncustomresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/constrainttemplates.templates.gatekeeper.sh created\nserviceaccount/gatekeeper-admin created\npodsecuritypolicy.policy/gatekeeper-admin created\nrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gatekeeper-manager-role created\nclusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gatekeeper-manager-role created\nrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gatekeeper-manager-rolebinding created\nclusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gatekeeper-manager-rolebinding created\nsecret/gatekeeper-webhook-server-cert created\nservice/gatekeeper-webhook-service created\ndeployment.apps/gatekeeper-audit created\ndeployment.apps/gatekeeper-controller-manager created\nWarning: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 ValidatingWebhookConfiguration is deprecated in v1.16+, unavailable in v1.22+; use admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 ValidatingWebhookConfiguration\nvalidatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/gatekeeper-validating-webhook-configuration created\nComponents of the OPA gatekeeper are installed in the gatekeeper-system namespace.

The contents of the example presented in the OPA gatekeeper document (https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/howto) are as follows.\napiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nkind: ConstraintTemplate\nmetadata:\n  name: k8srequiredlabels\nspec:\n  crd:\n    spec:\n      names:\n        kind: K8sRequiredLabels\n      validation:\n        # Schema for the `parameters` field\n        openAPIV3Schema:\n          properties:\n            labels:\n              type: array\n              items: string\ntargets:\n  - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh\n    rego: |\n      package k8srequiredlabels\n\n      violation[{\"msg\": msg, \"details\":] {\n        provided := {label | input.review.object.metadata.labels[label]}\n        required := {label | label := input.parameters.labels[_]}\n        missing := required - provided\n        count(missing) > 0\n        msg := sprintf(\"you must provide labels: %v\", [missing])\n      }\n7\n7 # Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/demo/basic/templates/k8srequiredlabels_template.yaml\nThe contents are as follows. First of all, the API type of the constraint template object is templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1. If you use the current version of the gatekeeper, you can use this value, and if the version goes up in the future, it can be templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1, and so on.\nThen, the name field in the metadata section defines the name of the constraint template. The spec section defines the specification of CRD, and the type of resource (Kind) defined by this CRD is K8sRequiredLabels, that is, the object for this resource is K8sRequiredLabels. And this resource has an attribute named labels, and the data type of the attribute is a string array.\nFor more information on CRD definitions, visit the official document of Kubernetes at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/).\nIn the last targets section, an array of objects with a target field and a rego field may come, and currently one object is used and the target is admisson.k8s.gatekeeper.sh. If a function is added to the gatekeeper, another target type may be added. The rego field contains a policy written in the rego language of OPA.\nThe policy written in Rego is as follows. First of all, the package is designated the same as metadata.name, and one partial rule named violation is defined. The name of the package and partial rule must follow these rules and at least one violation rule must exist. Looking at blogs and examples on the Internet, the name of the partial rule is often named deny, which is the name used in the previous version of the OPA gatekeeper, so you can change it to violation and apply it.\nThe vibration partial rule creates an object with msg and detail fields containing error messages for rule violations. If no rule violation was found, the vibration partial rules would produce no results, so the result of the rule evaluation would be an empty set. If there is a matching rule among the vibration partial rules and an error object is generated, the content of the object is recorded in the audit section, and the Kubernetes API request is not reflected and the error returns.\nLooking at the implementation of violation, first of all, while traversing the metadata.label item of the Kubernetes API object referred to as input.review.object.metadata.labels, the key of the label is named label, and collected as a set named provided using the set comprehension.\nAfter that, a required set is created with the labels attribute handed over to input.parameters.labels. Then, we obtain the difference set between requested and supplied to create a missing set. This makes up a missing set of labels that are not included in the Kubernetes API calling object among the labels that have been handed over as arguments in the policy. Next, we compare whether the number of components in the missing set is greater than zero. If it is greater than 0, an error message is generated as a sprintf built-in function and assigned from the msg variable. Finally, with the values of msg and missing variables, an object {\"msg\": msg\", details\": {\"missing_labels\": missing}} is created.\nTo generate a constraint template, enter the following command.\n$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/demo/basic/templates/k8srequiredlabels_template.yaml\nOPA Gatekeeper Constraint\nThis time, let's look at an example of the constraints presented in the OPA Gatekeeper document. The contents of the example are as follows.\napiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nkind: K8sRequiredLabels\nmetadata:\n  name: ns-must-have-gk\nspec:\n  match:\n    kinds:\n      - apiGroups: [\"\"]\n        kinds: [\"Namespace\"]\n  parameters:\n    labels: [\"gatekeeper\"]\n8 \n8 #Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/demo/basic/constraints/all_ns_must_have_gatekeeper.yaml\nFirst of all, the API type of the constraint template object is constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1. It may be seen that the value of the kind field is the same as that declared in the crd section of the previously declared constraint template. The name field in the metadata section declares the name of the constraint itself. \nThe match part of the spec section specifies the target to which this constraint applies, in which example only works when Kubernetes manipulates the namespace. The match part specifies the target to which the constraint is to be selected.\nThe conditions that may be located below match are Kinds specifying a list of Kubernetes API objects, scope limiting the range, namespace range such as full range (*), namespaces specifying the included namespaces, expanded namespaces specifying the Kubernetes label selector. When multiple conditions are specified, everyone must be satisfied.\nTo explain the most commonly used Kinds matching, kinds is an array of objects with kinds and apiGroups fields as sub-elements, and is matched if only one of the array objects matches. Kinds can be Namespace, Pod, Ingress, etc., and apiGroups do not exist in Pod, Namespace and Ingress can have several apiGroups. The list of apiGroups according to the object can be checked by executing the kubectl api-resources command.\nIn the parameters part of the spec section, attributes declared in the template were specified as a string array with one element, \"gatekeeper\", as declared in the constraint template. Examining the overall content, it can be expected that a constraint named ns-must-have-gk will reject creation if the label gatekeeper does not exist when a namespace is created in Kubernetes.\nLet's deploy this constraint to the next command.\n$ kubectl apply –f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/demo/basic/constraints/all_ns_must_have_gatekeeper.yaml\nCheck OPA Gatekeeper Working\nIf both the constraint template and the constraint have been deployed, let's test to see if the constraint works as expected. First, let's create a namespace that satisfies the constraints. Save the following contents as good_ns1.yaml.\nkind: Namespace\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: goodns1\nlabels:\n  gatekeeper: gatekeeper1\nWhen goodns1.yaml is applied as the next command, the goodns1 namespace is successfully created because it satisfies the constraints.\n$ kubectl apply -f goodns1.yaml\nnamespace/goodns1 created\nAnd let’s test another namespace goodns2 which satisfies the constraints.\nkind: Namespace\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: goodns2\nlabels:\n  gatekeeper: gw2\n  environment: production\nSince the content of goodns2.yaml satisfies the constraints, the goodns2 namespace was also successfully created.\n$ kubectl apply -f goodns2.yaml\nnamespace/goodns2 created\nThis time, let's test what happens if we violate the constraints. Write the following and save it as badns.yaml.\nkind: Namespace\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: badns\nlabels:\n  environment: production\nIf you run the command to apply badns.yaml as follows, you can see an error message that it has been rejected by the admssion webhook \"validation.gatekeeper.sh\" because it does not satisfy the constraint ns-must-have-gk. In addition, it may be seen that a detailed message (detail field) for an error provided by the constraint template is also output.\n$ kubectl apply -f badns.yaml\nError from server ([denied by ns-must-have-gk] you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}): error when creating \"badns.yaml\": admission webhook \"validation.gatekeeper.sh\" denied the request: [denied by ns-must-have-gk] you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\nIf you check the namespaces existing in Kubernetes with the following command, goodns1 and goodns2 exist, but badns do not exist. It is operating as expected.\n$ kubectl get namespace\nNAME STATUS AGE\ndefault Active 12d\ngatekeeper-system Active 35h\ngoodns1 Active 1h\ngoodns2 Active 1h\nkube-node-lease Active 12d\nkube-public Active 12d\nkube-system Active 12d\nCRD-related kubectl Commands for OPA Gatekeeper\nEarlier, it was explained that the resources used in the OPA gatekeeper are implemented as CRD. To verify the resources registered by the gatekeeper, grep the contents including gatekeeper among the output results of the kubectl api-resources command.\n$ kubectl api-resources |grep gatekeeper\nconfigs config.gatekeeper.sh true Config\nk8srequiredlabels constraints.gatekeeper.sh false K8sRequiredLabels\nconstraintpodstatuses status.gatekeeper.sh true ConstraintPodStatus\nconstrainttemplatepodstatuses status.gatekeeper.sh true ConstraintTemplatePodStatus\nconstrainttemplates templates.gatekeeper.sh false ConstraintTemplate\nIt can also be checked with the kubectl get crds command as follows, but if other CRDs have not been registered, only gatekeeper-related results can be viewed.\n$ kubectl get crds\nNAME CREATED AT\nconfigs.config.gatekeeper.sh 2021-02-10T02:22:31Z\nconstraintpodstatuses.status.gatekeeper.sh 2021-02-10T02:22:31Z\nconstrainttemplatepodstatuses.status.gatekeeper.sh 2021-02-10T02:22:31Z\nconstrainttemplates.templates.gatekeeper.sh 2021-02-10T02:22:31Z\nk8srequiredlabels.constraints.gatekeeper.sh 2021-02-10T13:51:58Z\nReturning to the execution result of the kubectl api-resources command and continuing the description, it has columns such as Name, SHORTNAMES, APIGROUP NAMESPACED, and KIND, which were removed due to the grep command in the above. The shortcut name field is empty because the resources added by the OPA gatekeeper do not have a shortcut name. You can also see the API group ending at gatekeeper.sh. Finally, it can be seen that the costraints template is also registered as CRD.\nIf you execute the kubectl get or kubectl describe command using the value of the name field, you can inquire related information.\nBy executing the command as follows, you can see a list of constraints templates and constraints.\n$ kubectl get constrainttemplates\nNAME AGE\nk8srequiredlabels 4h12m\n\n$kubectl get constraints\nNAME AGE\nk8srequiredlabels.constraints.gatekeeper.sh/ns-must-have-gk 4h23m\nIf you execute the kubectl get command using the name of the constraints template, you can see a list of constraints using the template.\n$ kubectl get k8srequiredlabels\nNAME AGE\nns-must-have-gk 3h23m\nIf you execute the command in the form of kubectl describe   for constraints as follows, you can also see an audit log that records violations in the Status field.\n$ kubectl describe k8srequiredlabels ns-must-have-gk\nName: ns-must-have-gk\nNamespace:\nLabels: \nAnnotations: \nAPI Version: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nKind: K8sRequiredLabels\n... \nStatus:\n...\nTotal Violations: 5\n  Violations:\n    Enforcement Action: deny\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: default\n    Enforcement Action: deny\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: gatekeeper-system\n    Enforcement Action: deny\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: kube-node-lease\n    Enforcement Action: deny\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: kube-public\n    Enforcement Action: deny\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: kube-system\nEvents: \nIf you look at the audit log, you can see that violation records remain for each namespace existing in the system. To resolve this part, the target namespace should be limited by processing the namespace out of the OPA gatekeeper or setting the namespace to be excluded from the constraints match section.\nOPA provides a dry-run mode that verifies Kubernetes constraints, leaves only an audit log, and does not fail to reflect Kubernetes.  In order to set a dry run, enforcementAction: dryrun can be added to the spec section of the constraint. Let's add enforcementAction: dryrun to the file containing the ns-must-have-gk constraints we wrote earlier and save them as all_ns_must_have_gatekeeper_dryrun.yaml.\napiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nkind: K8sRequiredLabels\nmetadata:\n  name: ns-must-have-gk\nspec:\n  enforcementAction: dryrun\n  match:\n    kinds:\n      - apiGroups: [\"\"]\n        kinds: [\"Namespace\"]\n  parameters:\n    labels: [\"gatekeeper\"]\nWhen the file is applied, the existing constraints will operate in dry-run mode because the constraints have not been renamed.\n$ kubectl apply -f all_ns_must_have_gatekeeper_dryrun.yaml\nk8srequiredlabels.constraints.gatekeeper.sh/ns-must-have-gk configured\nThen, by applying badns.yaml, which previously failed with the command, you can see that the badns namespace has been created.\n$ kubectl apply –f badns.yaml\nnamespace/badns created\nAs expected, it can be seen that badns were generated. If you check the audit log with the following command, you can see that the log remains in the audit log section. And it can be seen that when the audit log's Enforcement Action was not a dry run, it was deny but changed to a dry run.\n$ kubectl describe k8srequiredlabels ns-must-have-gk\nName: ns-must-have-gk\nNamespace:\nLabels: \nAnnotations: \nAPI Version: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nKind: K8sRequiredLabels\n...\nStatus:\n...\n  Violations:\n    Enforcement Action: dryrun\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: default\n    Enforcement Action: dryrun\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: gatekeeper-system\n    Enforcement Action: dryrun\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: kube-node-lease\n    Enforcement Action: dryrun\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: kube-public\n    Enforcement Action: dryrun\n    Kind: Namespace\n    Message: you must provide labels: {\"gatekeeper\"}\n    Name: kube-system\nEvents: \nOPA Gatekeeper Policy Library\nPolicy libraries available for the OPA gatekeeper are provided through https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library. First, let's replicate the Git repository as follows.\n$ git clone https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library\nIf you look at the downloaded content, there are three directories: src, test, and library, and src and test are directories containing sources and unit tests, respectively. Therefore, the policy to be used by the OPA gatekeeper must be found in the library directory.\n$ ls\nLICENSE Makefile NOTICE README.md library src test test.sh\nUnder the library directory, two subdirectories, general and pod-security-policy, are shown. You can also see kustomization.yaml, which is a file used for the purpose of collecting the entire template and creating it into one YAML, and does not need to be considered when using templates individually.\n$ cd library\n$ ls\ngeneral kustomization.yaml pod-security-policy\nGeneral Template\nTable 9-1 shows a list of general templates provided by the current version of the OPA Gatekeeper Library (as of February 2021.\n\n\n\nTemplate\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nallowedrepos\nAllow only a specific image repository\n\n\nblock-nodeport-services\nBlock service creation with NodePort\n\n\ncontainerlimits\nLimit the CPU and memory usage of the container\n\n\ncontainerresourceratios\nLimit the ratio of the container's CPU, memory limit, and initial request value\n\n\ndisallowedtags\nProhibited from having a specific tag in the container image\n\n\nexternalip\nRestricts IPs other than allowed external IPs from being set in spec.externalIPs items of the service\n\n\nhttpsonly\nDo not allow HTTP to ingress and allow HTTPS only\n\n\nimagedigests\nForcing the container image to include the digest\n\n\nrequiredlabels\nForce to include specific labels\n\n\nrequiredprobes\nForce a specified list of probes among liveness probes, readiness probes, and startup probes to be set\n\n\nuniqueingresshost\nForce new ingress not to use the same host of existing ingress\n\n\nuniqueserviceselector\nForce the service to have the unique selector in the namespace\n\n\n\nTable 9-1. PSP templates provided by the OPA gatekeeper library.\nFirst, let's find one of the templates in the general directory and look at the contents. Let's go to the imagedigest directory with the next command and then look at the directory structure with the tree command. Since the tree command is used only to examine the directory structure, it is not necessary to install it unless it is installed in the reader's environment.\n$ cd general/imagedigest\n$ tree\n.\n├── kustomization.yaml\n├── samples\n│   └── container-image-must-have-digest\n│   ├── constraint.yaml\n│   ├── example_allowed.yaml\n│   └── example_disallowed.yaml\n└── template.yaml\n\n2 directories, 5 files\nYou can see the template.yaml file at the top, which is a constraint template file. There is a sample directory below and a directory called container-image-must-have-digest. In this directory, there are constraint.yaml files that instantiate the constraint template to define the constraint, and sample_allowed.yaml files containing examples of permitted and rejected cases, respectively.  Other libraries have the same structure, but the difference is that depending on the name and library of the directory containing the example below the samples, there is only an example_disallowed.yaml file without an example_allowed.yaml. Among the libraries, required labels contain almost the same content as the label example discussed earlier in Chapter 9, and the directory structure is as follows.\n$ cd ../requiredlabels\n$ tree\n.\n├── kustomization.yaml\n├── samples\n│   └── all-must-have-owner\n│   ├── constraint.yaml\n│   └── example_disallowed.yaml\n└── template.yaml\nReturn to the imagedigests directory and look at the contents of the template.yaml file as follows.\napiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nkind: ConstraintTemplate\nmetadata:\n  name: k8simagedigests\n  annotations:\n    description: Requires container images to contain a digest.\nspec:\n  crd:\n    spec:\n      names:\n        kind: K8sImageDigests\n  targets:\n    - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh\n      rego: |\n        package k8simagedigests\n\n        violation[{\"msg\": msg}] {\n          container := input.review.object.spec.containers[_]\n          satisfied := [re_match(\"@[a-z0-9]+([+._-][a-z0-9]+)*:[a-zA-Z0-9=_-]+\", container.image)]\n          not all(satisfied)\n          msg := sprintf(\"container  uses an image without a digest \", [container.name, container.image])\n        }\n\n      violation[{\"msg\": msg}] {\n        container := input.review.object.spec.initContainers[_]\n        satisfied := [re_match(\"@[a-z0-9]+([+._-][a-z0-9]+)*:[a-zA-Z0-9=_-]+\", container.image)]\n        not all(satisfied)\n        msg := sprintf(\"initContainer  uses an image without a digest \", [container.name, container.image])\n      }\nThe contents are as follows. Two violation partial rules are defined, and regular expression matching is performed by taking the spec.containers and spec.initContainers parts of the Kubernetes object that have passed over, respectively. It is difficult to understand the pattern matching in the regular expression only by looking at the constraints, but it will be easy to understand by looking at the example to be explained soon. If the part is not matched, an error message is generated, assigned to msg, and an object with an msg field is generated in the partial rule.\nThis time, let's look at constrain.yaml containing constraints.\napiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nkind: K8sImageDigests\nmetadata:\n  name: container-image-must-have-digest\nspec:\n  match:\n    kinds:\n      - apiGroups: [\"\"]\n         kinds: [\"Pod\"]\n    namespaces:\n      - \"default\"\nFirst of all, the kind was declared K8sImageDigests as defined in the constraint template, and the name of the constraint is container-image-must-have-digest. Since the attribute is not defined in the constraint template, there is no attribute set in the constraint. Looking at the spec.match section, you can see that this constraint applies to the pod and only works for the \"default\" namespace that is applied when the namespace is not selected in Kubernetes.\nThis time, let's look at the contents of sample_allowed.yaml.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: opa-allowed\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: opa\n      image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.9.2@sha256:04ff8fce2afd1a3bc26260348e5b290e8d945b1fad4b4c16d22834c2f3a1814a\n      args:\n        - \"run\"\n        - \"--server\"\n        - \"--addr=localhost:8080\"\nIt is a common pod declaration, and it can be seen that the image field is added in the form of @: to the next part of the image name. Applying this example will be acceptable because the constraint template allows the container image to contain the digest portion, and the constraint extends the template to be applied to the pod of the default namespace. If the namespace is \"default\", it will be allowed because it satisfies the deployed constraints, and if it is another namespace, it will be allowed because it is not subject to constraint matching.\nNow let's look at the content of example_disallowed.yaml.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: opa-disallowed\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: opa\n      image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.9.2\n      args:\n        - \"run\"\n        - \"--server\"\n        - \"--addr=localhost:8080\"\nExcept for the fact that the pod has a different name and no image digest, other parts are the same as sample_allowed.yaml. Since there is no image digest, an error will occur if you try to apply it to the default namespace.\nLet's see if it works as we thought. In the imagedigests directory, run the following command to apply constraints templates and constraints.\n$ kubectl apply -f template.yaml\nconstrainttemplate.templates.gatekeeper.sh/k8simagedigests created\n$ kubectl apply -f samples/container-image-must-have-digest/constraint.yaml\nk8simagedigests.constraints.gatekeeper.sh/container-image-must-have-digest created\nThis time, let's apply example_allowed.yaml. After applying it as a kubectl application, you can see that a container is created by checking it with the kubectl get pod command.\n$ kubectl apply -f samples/container-image-must-have-digest/example_allowed.yaml\npod/opa-allowed created\n$ kubectl get pod\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nopa-allowed 0/1 ContainerCreating 0 6s\nNext, let's apply example_disallowed.yaml. You can see that it has failed as expected.\n$ kubectl apply -f samples/container-image-must-have-digest/example_disallowed.yaml\nError from server ([denied by container-image-must-have-digest] container  uses an image without a digest ): error when creating \"samples/container-image-must-have-digest/example_disallowed.yaml\": admission webhook \"validation.gatekeeper.sh\" denied the request: [denied by container-image-must-have-digest] container  uses an image without a digest \nThis time, let's see if we apply sample_disallowed.yaml to nondefault namespaces, pod is created as expected. As shown in the following command, it was confirmed that the container was created by applying it to the goodns1 namespace created at the beginning of Chapter 9 with the –n option in kubectl. After that, the pod was deleted using the kubectl delete.\n$ kubectl apply -n goodns1 -f samples/container-image-must-have-digest/example_disallowed.yaml\npod/opa-disallowed created\n\n$ kubectl get pod -n goodns1\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nopa-disallowed 1/1 Running 0 17s\n\n$ kubectl delete pod opa-disallowed -n goodns1\npod \"opa-disallowed\" deleted\nPSP Template\nIf the general directory is a common template available on the OPA gateway, the pod-security-policy contains templates related to the pod security policy (PSP), a resource related to container security of the pod. For more information on PSP, visit the official document of Kubernetes (https://kubernetes.io/ko/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/).\nTable 9-2 shows a list of PSP templates provided by the current version of the OPA Gatekeeper Library (as of February 2021).\n\n\n\nControl Aspect\nField Names in PSP\nGatekeeper Constraint and Constraint Template\n\n\n\n\nRunning of privileged containers\nprivileged\nprivileged-containers\n\n\nUsage of host namespaces\nhostPID, hostIPC\nhost-namespaces\n\n\nUsage of host networking and ports\nhostNetwork, hostPorts\nhost-network-ports\n\n\nUsage of volume types\nvolumes\nvolumes\n\n\nUsage of the host filesystem\nallowedHostPaths\nhost-filesystem\n\n\nWhite list of Flexvolume drivers\nallowedFlexVolumes\nflexvolume-drivers\n\n\nRequiring the use of a read only root file system\nreadOnlyRootFilesystem\nread-only-root-filesystem\n\n\nThe user and group IDs of the container\nrunAsUser, runAsGroup, supplementalGroups, fsgroup\nusers (not supported in Gatekeeper v3)\n\n\nRestricting escalation to root privileges\nallowPrivilegeEscalation, defaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation\nallow-privilege-escalation\n\n\nLinux capabilities\ndefaultAddCapabilities, requiredDropCapabilities, allowedCapabilities\ncapabilities\n\n\nThe SELinux context of the container\nseLinux\nseLinux\n\n\nThe Allowed Proc Mount types for the container\nallowedProcMountTypes\nproc-mount\n\n\nThe AppArmor profile used by containers\nannotations\napparmor\n\n\nThe seccomp profile used by containers\nannotations\nseccomp\n\n\nThe sysctl profile used by containers\nforbiddenSysctls,allowedUnsafeSysctls\nforbidden-sysctls\n\n\n\n9\n9 Source: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library/tree/master/library/pod-security-policy\nTable 9-2. PSP templates provided by the OPA gatekeeper policy library\nThe PSP template is not significantly different from the general template, so a description thereof will be omitted.\nConfiguration of OPA Gatekeeper\nData Replication Settings\nLooking at the gatekeeper policy libraries, in addition to the Kubernetes API calling object itself, there are libraries that can only work by examining other objects deployed to Kubernetes. For example, uniquingresshost among general libraries prevents the use of the same host as the existing ingress, but this requires that the host information of the existing ingress be available. This information is not shared by default in the OPA gatekeeper, but this information can be shared by setting the sync through the Configuration object.\nThe structure of the directory of library/general/uniqueingresshost in the policy library project is as follows.\n$ ~/gatekeeper-library/library/general/uniqueingresshost$ tree .\n.\n├── kustomization.yaml\n├── samples\n│   └── unique-ingress-host\n│   ├── constraint.yaml\n│   ├── example_disallowed.yaml\n│   └── example_disallowed2.yaml\n├── sync.yaml\n└── template.yaml\nIf you look at the contents, sync.yaml exists that was not found in other libraries. Sync.yaml contains a configuration object for this sync setting, and the contents are as follows. There is a sync setting in the lower part of the spec section. Uniqueresshost synchronizes the contents related to Ingress because it requires information from other Ingress. Looking at the result of the kubectl api-resources command, you can see that Ingress is registered in two API groups: extensions and networking.k8s.io, so there is an item for each.  The version field may specify a version supported by the installed Kubernetes for the corresponding object type (kind).\napiVersion: config.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1\nkind: Config\nmetadata:\n  name: config\n  namespace: \"gatekeeper-system\"\nspec:\n  sync:\n    syncOnly:\n      - group: \"extensions\"\n        version: \"v1beta1\"\n        kind: \"Ingress\"\n      - group: \"networking.k8s.io\"\n        version: \"v1beta1\"\n        kind: \"Ingress\"\nLet's look at another example of data replication settings. The replication settings described in the OPA gatekeeper official document https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/sync are as follows.\napiVersion: config.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1\nkind: Config\nmetadata:\n  name: config\n  namespace: \"gatekeeper-system\"\nspec:\n  sync:\n    syncOnly:\n      - group: \"\"\n        version: \"v1\"\n        kind: \"Namespace\"\n      - group: \"\"\n        version: \"v1\"\n        kind: \"Pod\"\nSynchronization is set for the pod and namespace, and the group field is an empty string because the pod and namespace are objects with no particular API group.\nLet's see how synchronized replication data is referenced when creating a policy from a constraint template to Rego. Opening template.yaml at the top of the uniqueresshost directory is as follows.\napiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1\nkind: ConstraintTemplate\nmetadata:\n  name: k8suniqueingresshost\n  annotations:\n    description: Requires all Ingress hosts to be unique.\nspec:\n  crd:\n    spec:\n      names:\n        kind: K8sUniqueIngressHost\n  targets:\n    - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh\n      rego: |\n        package k8suniqueingresshost\n\n        identical(obj, review) {\n          obj.metadata.namespace == review.object.metadata.namespace\n          obj.metadata.name == review.object.metadata.name\n        }\n\n        violation[{\"msg\": msg}] {\n          input.review.kind.kind == \"Ingress\"\n          re_match(\"^(extensions|networking.k8s.io)$\", input.review.kind.group)\n          host := input.review.object.spec.rules[_].host\n          other := data.inventory.namespace[ns][otherapiversion][\"Ingress\"][name]\n          re_match(\"^(extensions|networking.k8s.io)/.+$\", otherapiversion)\n          other.spec.rules[_].host == host\n          not identical(other, input.review)\n          msg := sprintf(\"ingress host conflicts with an existing ingress \", [host])\n        }\nIt can be seen that the constraint template refers to the  data.inventory.\nSynchronized data is accessible through data.inventory, and cluster-scoped objects can be accessed in the form of data.inventory.cluster][][], and namespace-scoped objects can be accessed through  data.inventory.namespace[][groupVersion][][].\nSince ns, otherappiversoin, and name are not assigned variables in the data.inventory.names[ns][otherappiversion][name], so they are output variables. If the types of \"Ingress\" are found while traversing data.ineventory.names, ns, otherappiversion, and name variables are assigned  to the namespace, version, name of the found Ingress. And after matching the version with extensions/or networking.k8s.io/ with a regular expression, if the hosts are the same, check for the same object. If it has the same host even though it is not the same object, it generates an error message response object. In the Kubernetes environment, the exercise of uniqingresshost is left up to the readers. \nExempting Namespace\nExempting a particular namespace can help performance by preventing policies in the namespace that are not required by constraints from being evaluated. As for the exempting, the Configuration object can be modified and applied in the same way as the previous section of sync for data replication was set. After creating the expending_ns.yaml as follows, you can run kubectl apply –f exempting_ns.yaml.\napiVersion: config.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1\nkind: Config\nmetadata:\n  name: config\n  namespace: \"gatekeeper-system\"\nspec:\n  match:\n    - excludedNamespaces: [\"kube-system\", \"gatekeeper-system\"]\n      processes: [\"audit\", \"webhook\", \"sync\"]\nIn this example, the kube-system namespace in which the Kubernetes system components are installed and the gatekeeper-system namespace in which the OPA gatekeeper components are installed were excluded. In addition, the exempting operation was designated as audit log, web hook, and data duplication, but if you simply designate processes: \"*\", you can perform an exemption for the entire operation.\nNote that if the name of the existing configuration object and the metadata section are the same, it is recognized as the same configuration object, so the existing data synchronization setting can be removed by applying only the above content. Therefore, in order to maintain the existing setting, the match part of the spec section should be applied as the content added to the existing spec part.\nThe official OPA gatekeeper document explains one more way to process the namespace exemption, but it can only be applied to the audit log and requires complicated processes such as adding namespace to arguments when executing the OPA gatekeeper container in the pod. Interested readers, check out the contents of https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/exempt-namespaces#exempting-namespaces-from-the-gatekeeper-admission-webhook-using---exempt-namespace-flag.\nWebhook Configuration\nTo set up the web hook of the OPA gatekeeper, you can find and modify the part of the YAML file you used for installation(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/release-3.3/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml). Find the section that kind of it is Validating Webbook Configuration, and then apply it using the kubectl apply. The web hook part of the file is as follows.\nWhat can be set up in the webhook is that the gatekeeper is set to operate only for CREATE and UPDATE as default values, and add DELETE is required if policies for verification of DELETE are needed to prevent user mistakes, add DELETE. Or changing the timeout value.\nIn addition, the part that requires attention in the webhook setting is the part set to Failure Policy: Ignore. The official document explains that in the event of a failure, it currently operates as an instance, so it was set to Ignore to reduce downtime and will be set to Fail when availability is secured in the future. However, in the state set to Ignore, a problem may occur because the request is executed when the webhook request fails. In the actual environment, it is better to change to Fail.\napiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration\nmetadata:\n  creationTimestamp: null\n  labels:\n    gatekeeper.sh/system: \"yes\"\n  name: gatekeeper-validating-webhook-configuration\nwebhooks:\n- clientConfig:\n    caBundle: Cg==\n    service:\n      name: gatekeeper-webhook-service\n      namespace: gatekeeper-system\n      path: /v1/admit\n  failurePolicy: Ignore # Change it to Fail when applying it to the production\n  name: validation.gatekeeper.sh\n  namespaceSelector:\n    matchExpressions:\n    - key: admission.gatekeeper.sh/ignore\n      operator: DoesNotExist\n  rules:\n  - apiGroups:\n    - '*'\n    apiVersions:\n    - '*'\n    operations: # To process DELETE, add -DELETE under -UPDATE\n    - CREATE\n    - UPDATE\n    resources:\n    - '*'\n  sideEffects: None\n  timeoutSeconds: 3\n- clientConfig:\n    caBundle: Cg==\n    service:\n      name: gatekeeper-webhook-service\n      namespace: gatekeeper-system\n      path: /v1/admitlabel\n  failurePolicy: Fail\n  name: check-ignore-label.gatekeeper.sh\n  rules:\n  - apiGroups:\n    - \"\"\n    apiVersions:\n    - '*'\n    operations:\n    - CREATE\n    - UPDATE\n    resources:\n    - namespaces\n  sideEffects: None\n  timeoutSeconds: 3\nOther Tools Available in the Kubernetes Environment\nConftest\nThe OPA gatekeeper should be installed on the Kubernetes because it operates as an admission webhook of Kubernetes. In addition, the dryrun mode does not act as a normal dryrun that checks policies and does not apply them, but it acts as record policy violations and does not refuse to apply them. If so, is there any way to verify the format of the YAML file containing Kubernetis objects only with the contents of the YAML file when integrating them into the CI/CD pipeline? Of course, the use of OPA binaries, OPA policies created by themselves, and rego files included in the src directory of the policy library will make it easier to build such CI/CD pipelines.\nConftest is a tool that can be used more conveniently for this purpose. Just as Helm makes it easier to deploy Kubernetes applications, Connectest makes it possible to share various OPA policies related to Kubernetes. Conftest makes it easier to verify and manage not only Kubernetes but also various file formats used in cloud native environments such as docker and terraform.\nThe usage method introduced on the Conftest Github page is as follows. Compared with the opa test command for unit test, it can be seen that the test result is specialized in verifying the configuration file passed as arguments. The OPA rules used by Conftest can also generate error messages through vibrations partial rules similar to the OPA gatekeeper.\n$ conftest test deployment.yaml\nFAIL - deployment.yaml - Containers must not run as root\nFAIL - deployment.yaml - Containers must provide app label for pod selectors\n\n2 tests, 0 passed, 0 warnings, 2 failures, 0 exceptions\nThe Github repository of Conftest is https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest, and refer to https://www.conftest.dev for related documents.\nUse OPA with Terraform\nTerraform is a tool that enables automation of infrastructure control for various cloud environments such as AWS, GCP, and Azure with code. If Terraform describes the shape of the desired infrastructure, it creates a change plan according to what needs to be changed in the current infrastructure state, and if the change plan is applied, changes will be applied to the actual infrastructure. The Terraform’s change plan is stored in its own binary format, but when converted into JSON, it can be verified beyond the JSON converted into OPA's input.\nLet's take a simple example. The following is a simple terraform file that uses dockers as infrastructure to create nginx containers and expose them to 8080 ports. Let's create a temp directory and save the following to main.tf.\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    docker = {\n      source = \"kreuzwerker/docker\"\n      version = \"2.11.0\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nprovider \"docker\" {\n}\n\nresource \"docker_container\" \"nginx\" {\n  image = \"nginx:latest\"\n  name = \"nginx_app\"\n  restart = \"always\"\n  ports {\n    internal = 80\n    external = 8080\n  }\n}\nBefore executing the example, let's first check whether a docker is running or not by executing a docker ps command. And if you don't have a terraform installed, you can download, extract, and then add the directory location to the PATH environment variable.

The authorization plug-in only needs to implement the Authorizer Java interface, and for the contents of the Authorizer interface, see https://kafka.apache.org/24/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/server/authorizer/Authorizer.html.\nTo use OPA for kafka authorization, the implementation of the Autroizer interface can transfer the arguments of the authorization request to the OPA REST server as input and return the results to the result of the authorization request again. Of course, rules for authorization must be written and configured on the OPA server, and how to configure the OPA server has already been covered in Chapter 7. Since the result of determining the authorization request of the Authorizer interface is ALLOWED/DENIED, you can return the result to boolean in the OPA rule.\nReferring to the OPA official document https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/kafka-authorization/, it explains how to link OPA to Kafka. In the official document, a module called kafka-authorizer (https://github.com/open-policy-agent/contrib/tree/master/kafka_authorizer)), not opa-kafka-plugin (https://github.com/Bisnode/opa-kafka-plugin)), is used. The module is provided in a repository where OPA's user contribution codes are collected, and the version is not clearly managed.\nEither is fine because it is a simple code that receives input from Kafka's Authorizer interface and delivers it to the OPA server, but opa-kafka-plugin is systematically managing the version, so it would be better to use opa-kafka-plugin.\nThe contents of the input transmitted through opa-kafka-plugin in Kafka are as follows.\n{\n  \"operation\": {\n    \"name\": \"Write\"\n  },\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"resourceType\": {\n      \"name\": \"Topic\"\n    },\n    \"name\": \"alice-topic1\"\n  },\n  \"session\": {\n    \"principal\": {\n      \"principalType\": \"alice-producer\"\n    },\n    \"clientAddress\": \"172.21.0.5\",\n    \"sanitizedUser\": \"alice-producer\"\n  }\n}\n10\n10 Source: https://github.com/Bisnode/opa-kafka-plugin\nYou can make a rule to determine the corresponding JSON input and return true/false, and set the URL of the plug-in to call the rule from the OPA server.\nFor more information, please refer to https://github.com/Bisnode/opa-kafka-plugin.\nopa-envoy-plugin\nRecently, more and more service meshes are applied together than only Kubernetes. The most representative and widely used service mesh is Istio. Istio had previously provided OPA integration through mixer components, but as mixer components were removed from the latest version, it was changed to a structure interlocked through the Envoy Authz filter. The Envoy Authz filter defines a gRPC protocol capable of linking authentication/authorization specifications for external authentication servers with the outside. Since almost all service mesh implementations use Envoy as a data plane, the method using the Envoy Authz filter can be easily applied to other service meshes.\nIt is too vast to explain the service mesh or Envoy itself, and the current Istio is changing at a rapid pace, so this book does not elaborate further. Interested readers should visit https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa-envoy-plugin.\nSummary\nChapter 9 describes the outline and method of use of OPA gatekeepers that can be applied to Kubernetis' own policies and authority management, not user applications. It also explained how to create and apply constraints templates and constraints for OPA gatekeepers, and how to check audit logs. In addition, we looked at policy libraries available at OPA gatekeepers. Finally, in addition to the OPA gatekeeper, other tools applicable to the Kubernetes-based environment were briefly introduced.\nChapter 10 examines how to implement built-in functions and expand basic OPA functions.\n"},"chap10/extending.html":{"url":"chap10/extending.html","title":"Chap 10.

OPA does not have a plug-in system that dynamically loads modules like programs implemented in Java or other languages, and uses a method of creating a new binary by expanding existing OPA implementations. This seems inevitable because the dynamic module system of the Go language itself is still constrained. However, although there is an inconvenience in building a binary, it can be expanded while maintaining readability and independence of the code by writing a new main function using the existing OPA code itself as if it were a library. Chapter 10 first examines how to create a new binary by adding built-in functions and plug-ins to the existing OPA binary. In addition, since the newly created binary has an added function compared to the existing OPA, version information must be filled out to express this. Therefore, a method of setting version information of a binary to prevent user confusion and enable shape management will also be described.\nFirst, access the OPA’s  Github repository (https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa)) and open the main.go file of the top directory. If the license and annotation part for the go:generate is omitted, the main contents are as follows.\n// Omit the license part.\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/cmd\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    if err := cmd.RootCommand.Execute(); err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\n// Omit the go:generate part\nAll you do in the main function is run cmd.Root Command.Execute() with error handling. The only task required to expand OPA is to create and register built-in functions or plug-ins before executing cmd.Root Command.Execute().\nOPA built-in function.\nImplementation of OPA built-in function.\nLet's look at the implementation of the OPA built-in function in an example. If you use the Go client library, you can run queries by adding built-in functions without building a new OPA binary. First, a project for example is created as follows.\n$ mkdir hellofunc\n$ cd hellofunc\n$ go mod init hellofunc\nWhen the project creation is completed, the main.go is created and stored with the following contents.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"strings\"\n\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/ast\"\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego\"\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/types\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    ctx := context.Background()\n\n    r := rego.New(\n        rego.Query(`result = equalsIgnoreCase(\"Hello\", \"HELLO\")`),\n        rego.Function2(\n            &rego.Function{\n                Name: \"equalsIgnoreCase\",\n                Decl: types.NewFunction(types.Args(types.S, types.S), types.B),\n            },\n            func(_ rego.BuiltinContext, a, b *ast.Term) (*ast.Term, error) {\n                if str1, ok := a.Value.(ast.String); ok {\n                    if str2, ok := b.Value.(ast.String); ok {\n\n                        equals := strings.EqualFold(string(str1), string(str2))\n                        return ast.BooleanTerm(equals), nil\n                    }\n\n                    return nil, nil\n                }\n\n                return nil, nil\n            },\n        ),\n    )\n\n    query, err := r.PrepareForEval(ctx)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    rs, err := query.Eval(ctx)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"result=%v\\n\", rs[0].Bindings[\"result\"])\n}\nBrief description of the contents of the code is a program that performs and outputs a query called result=equalsIgnoreCase (\"Hello\", \"HELLO\"), which created an equivalentIgnoreCase function that compares strings regardless of case and included it at the time of initialization. String comparison is a function that uses the strings.EqualFold function provided by the basic library of the Go language to compare whether the strings are the same for the UTF-8 string without case discrimination.\nThe parts related to the built-in function are as follows. First, create an option to call the rego.function2 function and hand it over to rego.New as an argument. rego.New takes over the list of func (*Rego) type functions as arguments, and reflects options by sequentially applying the functions taken over as arguments to the Rego data structure. This is a common code pattern in the Go language. In addition to rego.Function2, rego.Function1, rego.Function3, and rego.Function4 also exist, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 each represent the number of function arguments. When more arguments are needed, rego.FunctionDyn, which takes over the arguments in a dynamic array, can be used.\nIf you run the function as follows, you can see the expected results, and if it is the first time to run, additional contents for installing related go modules will be output. rego. FunctionXXX receives two arguments, the first argument being a pointer to the structure containing the declaration of the function, and the second being a function that implements the built-in function and is written as an anonymous function in the code. The declaration part contains the name of the function and the Decl field contains the type information of the function. In the above example, types.S and types.B represent String and Boolean types, respectively. Therefore, the EqualsIncoreCase function receives two string arguments and returns the bullion value.\nLooking at the anonymous function part, the anonymous function has one rego.BuiltinContext type argument and two ast.Term arguments. _ means that the corresponding argument  exists to match only the type without reference within the function, ast.Term type arguments  were named a and b, respectively. Also, the return value of the arguments are ast.Term and error type, and all arguments of the built-in function are also ast.Term type. The Term structure includes a Value containing values and a Location field containing location (file name, line, etc.) information in the Rego source code. if str1, ok := a.Value (ast.String);ok {} part is described as follows. After casting  a.Value as an ast.String type, if successful, the value is assigned to the str1 variable, ok = true, and the content of the block is executed. If casting is impossible, it becomes ok = false and the content of the block is not executed. In the nested if statement, Value field of a and b of *ast.Term types were cast as ast.String types, respectively, and converted into strings and handed over to the EqualFold function of the Go language. Ast.String is actually only an alias of a string type, but since it is recognized as a different type when compiling, string() conversion is required. Finally, the Boolean value returned as a result of the comparison was converted into ast.BooleanTerm and returned. As explained when explaining the use of OPA through the Go client library, the subsequent part is the part that executes queries, receives results, and outputs them.\nNow that we've finished describing the code, let's run it. If you run it as follows, you can see the expected result value.\n$ go run main.go\nresult=true\nIntegration of OPA built-in functions\nNow that we have learned how to implement the built-in function, let's implement the existing rule as a built-in function and run the unit test.\nIn the final API authorization scenario, including the API hierarchy described in Chapter 5, if API URLs are not matched, the function of matching higher URLs to verify permissions was implemented as a longestmatchapi rule. Due to the nature of the Rego language used by OPA, the longestmatchapi rule found all the matching top URLs without interruption on the way, and returned the first URLs sorted by url’s length in descending order. Since the built-in function is implemented in the Go language, you can return immediately without finding all higher URLs if you find a matching URL.\nFirst, let's create a directory that will act as a project under the name extfunc. After creation, go to the extfunc directory and execute the following command.\n$ go mod init extfunc\ngo: creating new go.mod: module extfunc\n\nThe Go module has been created and the created go.mod file is as follows. \n\nmodule extfunc\n\ngo 1.15\nCurrently, only the module name and Go version are specified, but if you add a library later, information related to dependence will also be added. If the Go version is 1.13 or higher, there will be no big problem.\nWrite the following and save it as main.go.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"strings\"\n\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/ast\"\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/cmd\"\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego\"\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/types\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    methodPermType := types.NewObject(nil, types.NewDynamicProperty(types.S, types.NewArray(nil, types.S)))\n\n    apiType := types.NewObject(nil, types.NewDynamicProperty(types.S, methodPermType))\n\n    rego.RegisterBuiltin3(\n        &rego.Function{\n            Name: \"longest_match_api\",\n            Decl: types.NewFunction(types.Args(apiType, types.S, types.S), types.S),\n            Memoize: false,\n        },\n        longestMatchAPI,\n    )\n\n    if err := cmd.RootCommand.Execute(); err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc longestMatchAPI(_ rego.BuiltinContext, api, url, method *ast.Term) (*ast.Term, error) {\n    if obj, ok := api.Value.(ast.Object); ok {\n        targetURL := string(url.Value.(ast.String))\n\n        for targetURL != \"\" {\n            targetAPI := obj.Get(ast.StringTerm(targetURL))\n\n            if targetAPI != nil && targetAPI.Get(method) != nil {\n                return ast.StringTerm(targetURL), nil\n            }\n\n            targetURL = upperURL(targetURL)\n        }\n    }\n\n    return nil, nil\n}\n\nfunc upperURL(url string) string {\n    last := strings.LastIndex(url, \"/\")\n\n    if last Let's look at the main function first. As explained earlier in Chapter 10, the main function registers the built-in function before executing cmd.Root Command.Execute(). To register a built-in function as a rego.RegisterBuiltin3 function, a rego.Function structure containing a function declaration and a function that implements the built-in function are used as arguments. Number 3 of rego.RegisterBuiltin3 represents the number of arguments similar to the previous example, and the rego.Function structure is generated inside rego.RegisterBuiltin3. Compared to the previous example, the argument type of the function is much more complex, and the first argument is the type for referring to the data.api object. The contents of the data.api object are as follows.\n{\n  \"api\": {\n    \"/users/{user_id}/profile\" : {\n      \"GET\": [\"profile.read\"],\n      \"PUT\": [\"profile.read\", \"profile.update\"]\n    },\n    ...\n  },\n...\n}\nThe api object is an object with a URL as a key and a value as an object containing authorization information. The key to the authorization object is an HTTP method, and the value is an array of strings containing permissions. The type of value of the api object was generated by types.NewObject (nil, types.NewDynamicProperty (types.S, types.NewArray (nil, types.S))). The first nil part of type.NewObject or type.NewArray is a list of static attributes. A static attribute refers to an essential attribute that an object must contain, for example, a field with a specific key, and in this example, there may be no key of the object and there is no static attribute because there is no essential attribute. The dynamic attribute is a key string type and the value is a string array. An object type having a dynamic attribute in which the string is the key type and the method PermType is the value type was defined as apiType.\nThe method of defining the type is not documented in detail in the official document, but readers who want to check the actual content can check the type/type.go file of the OPA source code. Type.go defines Null, String, Number, Boolean, Any, Function, Set, Object, Array, etc. When the actual code is checked, type S is also generated as var S = type.NewString(). Since it is a simple type, it refers to a value generated once without generating it every time. Types.N and types.B have similar patterns, such as generated by types.NewNumber() and types.NewBoolean(), respectively.\nLooking at the function declaration part, the name of the function is longest_api_match, and the type of arguments are data.api to receive the object, string for URL, and string for HTTP method, and the function returns the matched URL string. Memoize is a field that caches the results for functions and if the arguments are the same, the result returned from the cache. Memoize is set to false, the results are not cached. API permission data can be updated by bundle polling, etc., and the results can vary depending on the time of execution due to external effects, so it was set to false. In the opposite case, if we run a function called strlen (\"hello\") that counts the length of a string, we will always get 5, and we will not have a problem if we cache 5 for the argument \"hello\". With this deterministic function, it is possible to improve performance through caching by setting Memoize to true.\nLooking at the implementation of the function, as in the previous example, context information was not used, so it was referred as _, and three arguments were declared as *ast.Term type. Since api is a reference to an object, it was cast as ast.Object, and the Get function was called with the url as key, and if there was an item for that url, and the Get was called again with method as key. If no value is found, the upperURL function is called and repeated to change url to one level up.\nSince we have completed implementing the built-in function, let's compile the main.go and create a new OPA binary. The following command allows you to compile main.go and create a binary called opaex, which in a window environment requires an extension for execution, so let's specify opaex.exe instead of opaex.\n$ go build -o opaex main.go\nIf you run REPL for opa and newly built opaex as follows and invoke the longest_match_api function, you can see that the result is output as undefined, not the undefined function error in opaex.\n$ ./opaex run\nOPA 0.26.0 (commit , built at )\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands and check for updates.\n\n> longest_match_api({},\"\",\"\")\nundefined\n\n$ ./opa run\nOPA 0.26.0 (commit 62d3900, built at 2021-01-20T18:56:12Z)\n\nRun 'help' to see a list of commands and check for updates.\n> longest_match_api({},\"\",\"\")\n\n1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_type_error: undefined function longest_match_api\nThis time, let's modify the rego file containing the existing authorization scenario to use the newly added longest_match_api built-in function. Let's modify the content as follows and save it as a new file policy_extfunc.rego.\npackage example.urlhierarchy\n\ndefault allowed = false\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"ADMIN\"\n}\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"USER\"\n\n  input.user.target_user_id != \"\"\n  input.user.target_user_id == input.user.id\n}\n\nallowed {\n  input.user.role == \"OPERATOR\"\n\n  method := input.api.method\n  url := longest_match_api(data.api, input.api.url, method)\n\n  permission := data.operator_permission[input.user.id]\n  required_permssion := data.api[url][method]\n  satisfied_permission := {p | permissionmatch(permission[_], required_permssion[p], \".\")}\n\n  count(required_permssion) > 0\n  count(satisfied_permission) == count(required_permssion)\n}\n\nallowed {\n  method := input.api.method\n  url := longest_match_api(data.api, input.api.url, method)\n  url\n\n  required_permssion := data.api[url][method]\n\n  count(required_permssion) == 0\n}\n\npermissionmatch(permission, req_permission, delim) = true {\n  permission == req_permission\n} else = result {\n  result := startswith(req_permission, concat(\"\", [permission, delim]))\n}\nIf you check the changes, you can see that the part where the rule longestmatchapi (url, method) was declared has been completely removed and the rule call has been changed to a built-in function call. Unlike the rules, the built-in function cannot directly access the data, so it can also be confirmed that the data.api object was passed as the first argument of the function to refer to API authority.\nLet's run the unit test using the modified file. The test scenario used the same one written in Chapter 5. If you change only the rego file to the newly created policy_extfunc.rego and run it as it is with opa, an error occurs that the function cannot be found as follows.\n$ opa test -v policy_extfunc.rego policy_test.rego data.json\n2 errors occurred:\npolicy_extfunc.rego:21: rego_type_error: undefined function longest_match_api\npolicy_extfunc.rego:34: rego_type_error: undefined function longest_match_api\n\nLet's run the same command by adding built-in functions and turning them into built opaex binaries. It can be confirmed that the unit test was successfully executed.\n\n$ opaex test -v policy_extfunc.rego policy_test.rego data.json\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_admin_allowed: PASS (12.3149ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper1_profile_read_allowed: PASS (993µs)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper1_profile_update_allowed: PASS (1.0001ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper2_profile_read_allowed: PASS (999.7µs)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper2_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (522.4µs)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper3_profile_read_not_allowed: PASS (1.0086ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper3_profile_update_not_allowed: PASS (2.9998ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_user_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_user_not_allowed: PASS (1.0033ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_user_public: PASS (997.8µs)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_useroper_userlist_read_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_useroper_user_read_allowed: PASS (2.0002ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_useroper_user_update_not_allowed: PASS (1.0009ms)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_oper1_user_read_not_allowed: PASS (0s)\ndata.example.urlhierarchy.test_goods_not_allowed: PASS (998.9µs)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 15/15\nCompared to the implementation of longest_match_api as a built-in function, the implementation of OPA rules clearly has an inefficient aspect, but the above results alone do not show much difference.\nLet's check the actual performance using the benchmark function. According to the OPA official document, it is guided that to compare benchmark results, you can save benchmark results in the gobench format and compare them in benchstat.\nLet's install benchstat. If the Go compiler is installed, benchstat is installed by executing the following command\n$ go get -u golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat\nIf the benchstat command is not executed after installation, check GOPATH information by executing the goenv command. You can find it in the bin directory below GOPATH. The location can be added to the PATH\nFirst, let's save the performance of the policy.rego written using only the rule as the next command. The benchstat utility does not compare the results of one run with each other, so it was compared five times with the —count option. The OPA official document also explains that 5 to 10 times is enough. The default timeout was 5 seconds, but in the author's environment, a timeout occurred during some rule performance measurements, increasing it to 10 seconds with the –t option. Finally, the binary used opaex, which can be used as a pure opa binary, but when compiling the binary, there can be differences in other factors such as optimization options, and policy.rego can be executed with the opaex binary, so it was executed as an opaex binary to remove external elements\n$ opaex test -v -t 10s --count 5 --format gobench --bench policy.rego policy_test.rego data.json | tee policy.txt\nThe name of the policy file and the name of the file to save the result were changed and executed once more as follows.\n$ opaex test -v -t 10s --count 5 --format gobench —bench policy_extfunc.rego policy_test.rego data.json | tee extfunc.txt\nLet's compare the performance by transferring two files to the benchstat command. Comparing the performance, it can be seen that when the built-in function is used, the execution time is reduced to about 50%. In other words, it shows twice as much performance.\n$ benchstat policy.txt extfunc.txt\nname old time/op new time/op delta\nDataExampleUrlhierarchyTestAdminAllowed 90.8µs ± 0% 46.9µs ± 3% -48.39%

performance improvement is an impressive figure. However, the embedded function implementation can only be used through a separate binary build or through a method included in the use of the Go client library. Therefore, unless the performance difference is severe due to large data or complicated logic, implementing it with rego-written rules is much easier to manage and maintain, so we recommend implementation as a rule unless high performance is particularly important.\nOPA plug-in\nThis time, let's look at the expansion of functions through the OPA plug-in. The OPA built-in function provides functions that can be called in rules, while the plug-in implements extensions for REST servers or REPLs running through the opa run command.\nStructure of OPA plug-in\nWhat OPA requires to implement a plug-in is the implementation of a plug-in interface and a plug-in factory interface. Two interfaces must be implemented to register as an OPA plug-in. In addition, it provides a plug-in manager to manage the life cycle and state of the plug-in and to inquire with the status API.\nThe functions that the OPA plug-in should implement are as follows. Start, Stop, and Reconfigure are called when the plug-in starts, when it is interrupted, and when it is reset, respectively. Looking at these functions, it can be seen that they are all about the life-cycle of the plug-in.\ntype Plugin interface {\n    Start(ctx context.Context) error\n    Stop(ctx context.Context)\n    Reconfigure(ctx context.Context, config interface{})\n}\nThe interfaces that the plug-in factory should implement are as follows. Validate verifies that there is no problem with the configuration of the plug-in and performs tasks such as applying the default value if not set. New creates and returns a new plug-in instance with the configurations it has taken over.\ntype Factory interface {\n    Validate(manager *Manager, config []byte) (interface{}, error)\n    New(manager *Manager, config Plugin\n}\nThe plug-in may be registered by calling runtime.RegisterPlugin() before cmd.RootCommand.Execute() is called. The first argument in RegisterPlugin is the name of the plugin, and the second argument is the factory that creates the plugin.\nTo use the plug-in, you must set the plugins section of the OPA configuration file. The structure of the plugins section is as follows.\nplugins:\n  :\n    : \n    : \n...\n  :\n    : \n    : \n...\nWhen the OPA configuration file is loaded, the configuration information in the plugins section is transferred to the plugin having the same name as JSON with the corresponding : .\nPlug-in example\nLet's take an example and see how the actual plug-in works. The plug-in to create is a ping server plug-in that responds with a simple message when sending ping requests that are frequently used in various network program examples.\nThe first thing to do is to create a project. After creating a directory called pingplugin as follows, initialize the go module.\n$ mkidr pingplugin\n$ cd pingplugin\n$ go mod init\nBefore writing the code, let's define the plug-in configurations. The values to be used as configurations in the ping plug-in are port and response messages for the server, which are defined as follows, and stored under the name oppa_plugin.conf. This file is an OPA configuration file containing only plug-in settings and is in YAML format. Note that we need a space behind the colon.\nplugins:\n  pingpong_plugin:\n    port: 9992\n    msg: Pong!!!\nIn the plug-in example, the file was divided into three for code readability: main.go, factory.go, and plugin.go. Since it belongs to the same main package, splitting files does not affect each other's reference.\nFirst of all, the contents of main.go are as follows.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/cmd\"\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/runtime\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    runtime.RegisterPlugin(PluginName, Factory{})\n\n    if err := cmd.RootCommand.Execute(); err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n}\nAs described above, register the plug-in with runtime.RegisterPlugin() before executing cmd.RootCommand.Execute(). PluginName and Factory referred to what was declared in another file in the main package. The contents of plugin.go containing the implementation of plugin are as follows.\nThe contents of plugin.go containing the implementation of plugin are as follows.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"sync\"\n\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/plugins\"\n)\n\nconst PluginName = \"pingpong_plugin\"\n\nconst DefaultPort = 9999\nconst DefaultMessage = \"Pong!\"\n\ntype Config struct {\n    Port int32 `json:\"port\"`\n    Msg string `json:\"msg\"`\n}\n\ntype PingPongServer struct {\n    manager *plugins.Manager\n    mtx sync.Mutex\n    config Config\n}\n\nfunc (p *PingPongServer) Start(ctx context.Context) error {\n    log.Printf(\"Start PingPong Server, config=%+v\\n\", p.config)\n\n    start(&p.config)\n\n    p.manager.UpdatePluginStatus(PluginName, &plugins.Status{State: plugins.StateOK})\n\n    return nil\n}\n\nfunc (p *PingPongServer) Stop(ctx context.Context) {\n    log.Println(\"Stop PingPong Server\")\n\n    p.manager.UpdatePluginStatus(PluginName, &plugins.Status{State: plugins.StateNotReady})\n}\n\nfunc (p *PingPongServer) Reconfigure(ctx context.Context, config interface{}) {\n    p.mtx.Lock()\n    defer p.mtx.Unlock()\n\n    p.config = config.(Config)\n}\n\nfunc start(config *Config) {\n    listen := fmt.Sprintf(\":%d\", config.Port)\n\n    log.Printf(\"listen addr=%s\", listen)\n\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/ping\", func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {\n        fmt.Fprintf(res, \"%s\\n\", config.Msg)\n    })\n\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listen, nil))\n}\nThe PluginName constant referenced in main.go was defined in this file. The plug-in name is pingpong_plugin, and the plug-in configuration has a port field containing a port to operate the service and an msg field containing a response message. The plug-in's Start() function starts the HTTP server and changes the plug-in state to OK through the plug-in manager. The Stop() function of the plug-in changes the state of the plug-in to NotReady. The Configure() function is a function called when changing configuration, and it can be called multiple times concurrently, so the configuration will be guarded by a lock.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"log\"\n\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/plugins\"\n    \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/util\"\n)\n\ntype Factory struct{}\n\nfunc (Factory) New(m *plugins.Manager, config interface{}) plugins.Plugin {\n\n    log.Printf(\"Config=%+v\\n\", config)\n\n    m.UpdatePluginStatus(PluginName, &plugins.Status{State: plugins.StateNotReady})\n\n    return &PingPongServer{\n        manager: m,\n        config: config.(Config),\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (Factory) Validate(_ *plugins.Manager, config []byte) (interface{}, error) {\n    parsedConfig := Config{}\n    err := util.Unmarshal(config, &parsedConfig)\n\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Println(\"Error occured while validate config:%v\\n\", err)\n    } else {\n        if parsedConfig.Msg == \"\" {\n            parsedConfig.Msg = DefaultMessage\n        }\n\n        if parsedConfig.Port == 0 {\n            parsedConfig.Port = DefaultPort\n        }\n    }\n\n    return parsedConfig, err\n}\nNew and Validate functions for plug-in factory and the Factory structure implemented. The New function initializes the plug-in state to the StatusNotReady state and returns the PingPongServer struct with the pointer of the plug-in manager and the pointer of the configuration. The Validate function parses the configurations and places them in the Config struct declared in plugin.go. If the Msg or Port field is not set, the default constants declared in plugin.go are set.\nTo build the code, the following command can be executed, and the binary to be generated is named opapp.\n$ go build –o opapp\nOnce the build is complete, let's operate the server with a configuration file with oppa_plugin.conf, as specified when operating the OPA server.\n$ ./opapp run -s –c opa_plugin.conf\n2021/02/24 15:09:32 Config={Port:9992 Msg:Ping!!!}\n{\"addrs\":[\":8181\"],\"diagnostic-addrs\":[],\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"Initializing server.\",\"time\":\"2021-02-24T15:09:32+09:00\"}\n2021/02/24 15:09:32 Start PingPong Server, config={Port:9992 Msg:Pong!!!}\n2021/02/24 15:09:32 listen addr=:9992\nWhen the service operates, sending an http request to the /ping URL for the port responds with a configured message.\n$ curl localhost:9992/ping\nPong!!!\nSetting Plug-in Version\nLet's check the version of the opapp binary with the ping plug-in added with the next command. When checking the contents, the OPA version, Go version, and web assembly support were displayed, but information related to the build was not displayed.\n$ ./opapp version\nVersion: 0.26.0\nBuild Commit:\nBuild Timestamp:\nBuild Hostname:\nGo Version: go1.15.2\nWebAssembly: unavailable\nIf there is a way to express that the version information is a different OPA binary from the official version including the ping plug-in, modifying the version information may prevent confusion.\nThe following is the content of the version/version.go file containing the output version information among the OPA source codes. When importing the OPA library into the module, a stable version of 0.26, is installed, and since it is the master branch of the source code, the version variable is set to 0.27.0-dev, which is the current development version.\npackage version\n\nimport (\n    \"runtime\"\n)\n\nvar Version = \"0.27.0-dev\"\n\nvar GoVersion = runtime.Version()\n\nvar (\n    Vcs = \"\"\n    Timestamp = \"\"\n    Hostname = \"\"\n)\nIn order to change the above values so that any version is recorded and output in the binary, you can override a specific variable value by setting a compiler option at the time of build. It is similar to setting the property with the -D option when executing Java, but the difference is that it is applied when compiling and included in the binary.\nLet's rebuild using the next command. The version.version variable of opa was set to 0.26+pingplugin to show that the OPA 0.26 version contains a ping plugin, and the host name where the source code was built was set to devpc\n$ go build –o opapp -ldflags \"-X github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/version.Version=0.26+pingplugin –X github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/version.Hostname=devpc“\nIf you check the version command again for the modified binary, it changed as follows.\n$ ./opapp version\nVersion: 0.26+pingplugin\nBuild Commit:\nBuild Timestamp:\nBuild Hostname: devpc\nGo Version: go1.15.2\nWebAssembly: unavailable\nCommit information and timestamp related to the build are different only from the field name, but can be changed in the same way. Changing to build relevant information has to work and CI/CD will be a great help to manage the version.\nSpecial OPA plugins\nThe OPA plug-in does not require anything special other than implementing the plug-in factory interface and the plug-in interface, but some of the OPA's features define a more specific interface so that it can easily replace certain functions of the OPA with other implementations.\nThe current OPA version (0.26 when writing) defines two more specific plug-in interfaces: an HTTP authentication plug-in that allows users to set authentication methods, such as tokens, and a policy logger plug-in that leaves policy logs.\nIn addition to the Plugin interface, the HTTP authentication plugin must implement the following HTTPAuthPlugin interface. The NewClient function creates an HTTP client from the setting and returns pointers and errors. The Prepare function takes over the pointer of the http.Request structure and implements the task of setting the token in the HTTP header before HTTP request.\ntype HTTPAuthPlugin interface {\n    NewClient(c Config) (*http.Client, error)\n    Prepare(req *http.Request) error\n}\nWhen using an HTTP authentication plugin, you can declare plugin and plugin properties in the plugins section, and then specify the plugin name in the plugin properties of the services..credentials section. For example, if you have developed an HTTPAuthPlugin plugin named my_auth which accepts token abc1234, you can configure it as follows.\nservices:\n  my_service:\n     url: https://localhost/sevice/v1/\n     credentials:\n        plugin: my_auth\n  plugins:\n    my_auth:\n      token: abc1234\nExamples of implementations of HTTP authentication plug-ins are well explained on the official website, so they are not explained again in this book. Related information can be found at https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/configuration/#example-4.\nThe policy logger plug-in requires additional implementation of the Log function on the existing plug-in interface as follows. Declaring other interfaces inside the interface, such as plugin.Plugin, means that in the Go language, the inner interface must be also implemented. Since plugin.Plugin must be implemented when implementing the HTTP authentication plugin above, there is no difference even if HTTPAuthPlugin is forced to implement plugin.Plugin.\ntype Logger interface {\n    plugins.Plugin\n\n    Log(context.Context, EventV1) error\n}\nThe decision logger plug-in can be set in a similar way. If you have developed a plug-in called new_decision_logger and have the settings set to leave a log only if an error occurs, the settings will be as follows.\ndecision_logs:\n  plugin: new_decision_logger\nplugins:\n  new_decision_logger:\n    onlyerror: false\nExamples of decision logger plugins are well explained on the official website, so they are not explained again in this book. Related information can be found at https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/extensions/#putting-it-together.\nAs OPA development progresses further, it is expected that there will be more and more parts that can replace the basic functions of OPA with plug-ins. In addition, the functions of plug-in and OPA exchanging information and controlling plug-in will gradually expand. At the time readers read books, more may be implemented as plug-ins, so it is recommended to check the OPA official document once again.\nSummary\nChapter 10 describes how to expand OPA through built-in functions and plug-ins. In Chapter 5, the part that could not be efficiently implemented when implemented as a rule was re-implemented and operated as a built-in function. It also looked at how to build an OPA binary including extensions and how to modify version information of a newly created binary. Finally, HTTP authentication and decision logger plugins that can be replaced through a more specific plug-in interface among the basic operations of OPA have also been briefly described.\nThe contents described in Chapter 10 are those that must be developed in the Go language. Chapter 11 describes a web assembly that shows the direction that can be used without developing it in a Go language or operating OPA as a separate REST server.\n"},"chap11/wasm.html":{"url":"chap11/wasm.html","title":"Chap 11.

In particular, it will be very interesting to implement OPA policies locally by linking web assembly runtime with a library without a separate OPA web server in node.js and Java programs. Recently, OPA development has been centered on areas related to web assemblies, and the reasons, current constraints, and future prospects are also described.\nUtilization of Web Assembly in OPA\nWeb Assembly Overview\nThe Web Assembly (or WASM) is a standard for compiling programs written in various languages and creating executable binary on the web at a speed close to native. It is currently written around HTML and JavaScript running in a web browser, and when web assemblies are applied, codes written in C++, Java, and Rust can be compiled into a common binary format and then executed through web assembly runtime built into the browser. In addition, the web assembly runtime may operate in conjunction with the JavaScript engine.\nA web assembly compiler is used to compile code written in each language into a web assembly binary. Rego used by OPA is also a kind of programming language, and OPA also provides a compiler that compiles the Rego language into a web assembly binary.\nWeb assembly runtime running a web assembly binary is generally built into a web browser, but recently, WASI(Web Assembly System Interface), which can connect web assembly runtime with various languages other than Java scripts, has attracted attention. With WASI support runtime, compiled web assembly binaries in environments other than web browsers can be used in conjunction with codes written in other development languages. Widely used web assembly runtime includes wasmer and wasmtime, and these times provide binding that can be used in various languages. In addition to web assembly runtime, OPA utilizes these bindings to implement additional functions necessary for implementing OPA policies.\nAdvantages that can be expected through Web Assembly Support\nThere are two reasons why the OPA project is strengthening support for web assemblies.\n1) Support various developed languages.\nUnlike other policy-only languages, OPA provides a variety of built-in functions. Providing various built-in functions is an advantage, but if OPA is ported to various development languages other than the Go language, a large number of built-in functions as well as the Rego language execution engine must be newly developed and compatible with existing built-in functions.\nIf the built-in function is written as a web assembly and the web assembly runtime is integrated into the program in the form of a library, it can be used in languages that support web assembly integration with just one development of the built-in function. This is much more advantageous not only in redundant development, but also in compatibility because built-in functions to be executed in various languages operate through the same web assembly code.\n2) Advantageous for improving performance.\nSince web assemblies are developed on the premise of universal use, they will be used in many projects and are likely to improve performance with the help of many developers. The speed of performance improvement of web assemblies is likely to be much faster than the speed of improving rego runtime on its own in OPA.\nIf web assembly performance is further improved, patterns using Rego for policy development and testing in OPA and web assembly binary compiled into web assemblies for policy execution may be generalized.\nRequirements for using Web Assemblies in OPA\nOPA provides the ability to generate a web assembly bundle by compiling a Rego language into a web assembly module in a bundle generation tool. The bundle thus generated contains a policy.wasm file instead of policy.rego inside bundle.tar.gz. If bundle.tar.gz is decompressed, the wasm file can be extracted. But this policy.wasm requires additional capabilities for runtime should be to work through. Official documents of the OPA indicate that SDKs are needed for this, and the list of web assemblies SDKs that can be used for OPA is shown in Table 11-1.\n\n\n\nSDK\nProgramming language\nProject homepage\n\n\n\n\ngolang-opa-wasm\nGo\nhttps://github.com/open-policy-agent/golang-opa-wasm\n\n\nnpm-opa-wasm\nnode.js\nhttps://github.com/open-policy-agent/npm-opa-wasm\n\n\ndotnet-opa-wasm\n.Net\nhttps://github.com/christophwille/dotnet-opa-wasm\n\n\npython-opa-wasm\nPython\nhttps://github.com/a2d24/python-opa-wasm\n\n\n\nTable 11-1. OPA SDKs for the Web Assembly\nUsing the above SDKs, it is possible to load and execute OPA policies compiled into web assemblies in each supported language. For languages that did not exist in the past, SDK must be created according to the method guided on the website to use the web assembly policy. In the second half of Chapter 11, we will produce a simple Java SDK and implement policies.\nUsing the OPA Web Assembly through npm-opa-wasm\nLet's write a node.js application that loads and evaluates OPA policies compiled into the web assembly using npm-opa-wasm.\nFirst, create a directory to use as a project, and install the npm-opa-wasm module at npm. Readers who do not have node.js installed must download and install node.js suitable for the platform used by https://nodejs.org/en/download/ prior to executing the command.\n$ mkdir node-opa-wasm-example\n$ cd node-opa-wasm-example\n$ npm install @open-policy-agent/opa-wasm\nThe policies to be used for testing are as follows. The content of the code is a rule in which allowed becomes true when admin is true by inquiring the user value in the role object with a key and comparing the user's role with \"admin\".\npackage opa.wasm.test\n\ndefault allowed = false\n\nallowed {\n  user := input.user\n  data.role[user] == \"admin\"\n}\nThe data to be used for the test is defined as follows. Since \"alice\" is \"admin\", if input.user is \"alice\", opa.wasm.test.allowed will be true.\n{\n  \"role\" : {\n    \"alice\" : \"admin\",\n    \"bob\" : \"user\"\n  }\n}\nOnce the policy and data file creation is complete, let's create a web assembly bundle. Web assembly bundle creation also uses the opa build command, and the target should be designated as the web assembly with the -t wasm option and the query to be executed should be designated as the –e option. Note that / is used as the separator instead of . when specifying a query\nLet's run the command as follows to generate a bundle, and then verify that the bundle contains policy.wasm with the tar command.\n$ opa build -t wasm –e ‘opa/wasm/test/allowed’ policy.rego data.json\n$ tar tvzf bundle.tar.gz\ntar: Removing leading `/' from member names\n-rw------- 0/0 40 1970-01-01 09:00 /data.json\n-rw------- 0/0 108 1970-01-01 09:00 /policy.rego\n-rw------- 0/0 404411 1970-01-01 09:00 /policy.wasm\n-rw------- 0/0 101 1970-01-01 09:00 /.manifest\nLet's run the following command and extract the policy.wasm file from bundle.tar.gz.\n$ tar xvf bundle.tar.gz /policy.wasm\ntar: Removing leading `/' from member names\n/policy.wasm\nSince the web assembly file is also ready, let's write a node.js code using it. Write the following code and save it as app.js.\nconst { loadPolicy } = require(\"@open-policy-agent/opa-wasm\");\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nconst policyWasm = fs.readFileSync('policy.wasm');\nconst dataJson = fs.readFileSync('data.json','utf-8');\n\ninput = JSON.parse('{\"user\": \"alice\"}');\ndata = JSON.parse(dataJson);\n\nloadPolicy(policyWasm).then(policy => {\n  policy.setData(data);\n  resultSet = policy.evaluate(input);\n  if (resultSet == null) {\n    console.error(\"evaluation error\")\n  }\n  if (resultSet.length == 0) {\n    console.log(\"undefined\")\n  }\n  console.log(\"resultSet=\" + JSON.stringify(resultSet))\n  console.log(\"result=\" + resultSet[0].result)\n}).catch( error => {\n  console.error(\"Failed to load policy: \", error);\n})\nTo explain the content of the code, read the policy.wasm file and load the policy by calling the loadpolicy function imported from the @open-policy-agent/opa-wasm module. When the policy is successfully loaded, set the data using setData, pass the JSON formatted input to the evaluation to evaluate the policy, and output the policy evaluation result to the console. Note that inputs and data must pass parsed JSON objects rather than strings. If you pass the string as an argument, it doesn't work as you think. By executing the code written with the following command, you can see that the expected result has been output.\n$ node app.js\nresultSet=[{\"result\":true}]\nresult=true\nWrite an OPA Web Assembly SDK for Java\nThis section briefly describes how to write the OPA Java Web Assembly SDK so that the OPA policy can be used in Java, which is widely used for enterprises. Referring to the contents described in this section and the source code of the book, a simple OPA policy can be used in Java programs. Since the simple code aims to show that OPA can be utilized through a web assembly in Java, it is recommended to use a Go client library, npm-opa-wasm SDK, or a separate OPA server for actual service application. The github repository of SDK described in this section is https://github.com/sangkeon/java-opa-wasm\nRequirements of the Web Assembly SDK\nThe web assembly SDK makes it easier to write code because it performs various tasks instead of using the OPA policy compiled from the SDK to the web assembly.\nBefore explaining the requirements of SDK, let's take a look at the wasm binary created by OPA. The file of the wasm extension is binary, so let's convert it to wat format. The wasm2wat utility included in the Web Assembly Binary Toolkit (WABT) can be used for conversion to the wat format. Access https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/releases and install a binary suitable for the platform you use. Once the installation is complete, let's convert the wasm file into wat format with the next command.\n$ wasm2wat policy.wasm -o policy.wat\nThe contents of the converted policy.wat file are as follows.\n(module\n(type (;0;) (func (param i32 i32 i32) (result i32)))\n(type (;1;) (func (param i32 i32) (result i32)))\n(type (;2;) (func (param i32 i32)))\n(type (;3;) (func (param i32 i32 i32 i32)))\n(type (;4;) (func (param i32)))\n(type (;5;) (func (param i32) (result i32)))\n(type (;6;) (func (param i32 i32 i32 i32 i32)))\n(type (;7;) (func (param i32 i32 i32)))\n(type (;8;) (func (param i32 i32 i32 i32 i32 i32 i32)))\n(type (;9;) (func (param i32 i32 i32 i32) (result i32)))\n(type (;10;) (func (param i32 i32 i32 i32 i32 i32) (result i32)))\n(type (;11;) (func (param i32 i32 i32 i32 i32) (result i32)))\n... \n(type (;28;) (func (param i32 i32 i32 i32 i32 i32 i32 i32) (result i32)))\n(import \"env\" \"memory\" (memory (;0;) 2))\n(import \"env\" \"opa_abort\" (func $opa_abort (type 4)))\n(import \"env\" \"opa_builtin0\" (func $opa_builtin0 (type 1)))\n(import \"env\" \"opa_builtin1\" (func $opa_builtin1 (type 0)))\n(import \"env\" \"opa_builtin2\" (func $opa_builtin2 (type 9)))\n(import \"env\" \"opa_builtin3\" (func $opa_builtin3 (type 11)))\n(import \"env\" \"opa_builtin4\" (func $opa_builtin4 (type 10)))\n(func $opa_agg_count (type 5) (param i32) (result i32)\n(local i32 i32 i32 i64)\nglobal.get 0\ni32.const 16\ni32.sub\n...\nIf you look at the contents, you can feel that it is a web assembly module because you can feel similar to the assembly language. The very beginning of the module lists the types of functions used in the module. Most of the factors and return types are i32, which means a 32-bit integer type. Almost all types of OPA are i32 because it uses a 32-bit memory location offset when communicating with a web assembly module.\nAfter the type declaration part, there is an import statement for the external module. A module called \"env\" is loading memory and functions, which is not a library defined as a default for the web assembly, but a module that should be provided by the OPA web assembly SDK. If you want to link with the Java program through web assembly runtime, you need to create and connect the Java env module, and if you want to link with the Python program, you need to create the env module with Python. The env module contains shared memory to be used to exchange data with web assembly code, a handler called when a function that is not implemented as a web assembly exists among built-in functions.\nThe next part is the functions created by OPA, which are functions for loading, evaluating, and querying built-in functions and OPA policies. Functions such as setData and evaluation used in the previous example call OPA module functions several times inside. The implementation of the interval function in the app.js file of npm-opa-wasm is as follows. Functions present in this.wasmInstance.exports are functions included in the module when the OPA creates a web assembly module. The SDK serves to provide an API that can be easily used by users by enclosing low-level function calls directly dealing with these memory locations.\nevaluate(input) {\n  // Heap pointer initialization before evaluation\n  this.wasmInstance.exports.opa_heap_ptr_set(this.dataHeapPtr);\n\n  // Loading input data, _loadJSON is also a function implemented by SDK.\n  const inputAddr = _loadJSON(this.wasmInstance, this.mem, input);\n\n  // Context setup for evaluation\n  const ctxAddr = this.wasmInstance.exports.opa_eval_ctx_new();\n  this.wasmInstance.exports.opa_eval_ctx_set_input(ctxAddr, inputAddr);\n  this.wasmInstance.exports.opa_eval_ctx_set_data(ctxAddr, this.dataAddr);\n\n  // Actual evaluation\n  this.wasmInstance.exports.eval(ctxAddr);\n\n  // Check the results\n  const resultAddr = this.wasmInstance.exports.opa_eval_ctx_get_result(\n    ctxAddr,\n  );\n\n  // Read JSON in the memory and return it\n  return _dumpJSON(this.wasmInstance, this.mem, resultAddr);\n}\nDefine Java SDK Interface\nLet's define the Java interface for the OPA web assembly SDK. The interface to be defined here is defined only from the perspective of the Java interface regardless of the type of web assembly runtime.\nAs described above, the names of modules, memories, and functions required to implement the env module required by OPA are defined as follows. These names are subject to import from the standpoint of the OPA web assembly module.\n// Definitions for OPA WASM import\npublic static final String MODULE = \"env\";\npublic static final String MEMORY = \"memory\";\n\npublic static final String OPA_ABORT = \"opa_abort\";\npublic static final String OPA_BUILTIN0 = \"opa_builtin0\";\npublic static final String OPA_BUILTIN1 = \"opa_builtin1\";\npublic static final String OPA_BUILTIN2 = \"opa_builtin2\";\npublic static final String OPA_BUILTIN3 = \"opa_builtin3\";\npublic static final String OPA_BUILTIN4 = \"opa_builtin4\";\npublic static final String OPA_PRINTLN = \"opa_println\";\nThe names of functions that are exported externally by the OPA web assembly module are defined as follows.\n// Definitions for OPA WASM Export\npublic static final String OPA_MALLOC = \"opa_malloc\";\npublic static final String OPA_HEAP_PTR_GET = \"opa_heap_ptr_get\";\npublic static final String OPA_HEAP_PTR_SET = \"opa_heap_ptr_set\";\npublic static final String OPA_JSON_DUMP = \"opa_json_dump\";\npublic static final String OPA_JSON_PARSE = \"opa_json_parse\";\npublic static final String OPA_EVAL_CTX_NEW = \"opa_eval_ctx_new\";\npublic static final String OPA_EVAL_CTX_SET_INPUT = \"opa_eval_ctx_set_input\";\npublic static final String OPA_EVAL_CTX_SET_DATA = \"opa_eval_ctx_set_data\";\npublic static final String OPA_EVAL_CTX_GET_RESULT = \"opa_eval_ctx_get_result\";\npublic static final String BUILTINS = \"builtins\";\npublic static final String EVAL = \"eval\";\npublic static final String ENTRYPOINTS = \"entrypoints\";\npublic static final String OPA_EVAL_CTX_SET_ENTRYPOINT = \"opa_eval_ctx_set_entrypoint\";\npublic static final String OPA_FREE = \"opa_free\";\npublic static final String OPA_VALUE_PARSE = \"opa_value_parse\";\npublic static final String OPA_VALUE_DUMP = \"opa_value_dump\";\npublic static final String OPA_VALUE_ADD_PATH = \"opa_value_add_path\";\npublic static final String OPA_VALUE_REMOVE_PATH = \"opa_value_remove_path\";\nThe types and descriptions of the functions exported by OPA can be found in the official document https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/wasm/#exports. Porting the functions described in the official document to the Java interface is as follows. The web assembly type uses 32-bit integer types for both address and error code, but since integer types can cause confusion, memory addresses are defined as OPAAddr classes with int variables inside, and OPAErrorCode is defined as enum. The method of connecting this interface with the OPA web assembly code depends on the API provided by the web assembly runtime used.\npublic interface OPAExportsAPI {\n  public OPAErrorCode eval(OPAAddr ctxAddr);\n\n  public OPAAddr builtins();\n\n  public OPAAddr entrypoints();\n\n  public OPAAddr opaEvalCtxNew();\n\n  public void opaEvalCtxSetInput(OPAAddr ctxAddr, OPAAddr inputAddr);\n\n  public void opaEvalCtxSetData(OPAAddr ctxAddr, OPAAddr dataAddr);\n\n  public void opaEvalCtxSetEntryPoint(OPAAddr ctxAddr, int entrypoint_id);\n\n  public OPAAddr opaEvalCtxGetResult(OPAAddr ctxAddr);\n\n  public OPAAddr opaMalloc(int bytes);\n\n  public void opaFree(OPAAddr addr);\n\n  public OPAAddr opaJsonParse(OPAAddr addr, int jsonLength);\n\n  public OPAAddr opaValueParse(OPAAddr addr, int jsonLength);\n\n  public OPAAddr opaJsonDump(OPAAddr valueAddr);\n\n  public OPAAddr opaValueDump(OPAAddr valueAddr);\n\n  public void opaHeapPtrSet(OPAAddr addr);\n\n  public OPAAddr opaHeapPtrGet();\n\n  public OPAErrorCode opaValueAddPath(OPAAddr baseValueAddr, OPAAddr pathValueAddr, OPAAddr valueAddr);\n\n  public OPAErrorCode opaValueRemovePath(OPAAddr baseValueAddr, OPAAddr pathValueAddr);\n}\nLooking at the defined interface, it can be seen that the web assembly does not directly forward data such as strings, but forward it to memory addresses. How to process data in memory addresses is covered in the implementation section.\nLinking Web Assembly Runtime\nWasmtime (https://wasmtime.dev/) was used as a runtime for the web assembly. Wasmtime is a web assembly runtime written in rust that provides binding for Rust, Python, Dotnet, Go, and C languages through official projects, and there are various projects managed by external contributors, although not directly managed by official projects. In the case of Java, there are two projects: https://github.com/kawamuray/wasmtime-java and https://github.com/bluejekyll/wasmtime-java under the name of wasmtime-java, and they only have the same name but provide different APIs.\nThe OPA web assembly Java SDK implementation of this book uses https://github.com/kawamuray/wasmtime-java, which provides the import feature to implement the ability to connect OPA’s env modules to web assembly runtime. If readers want to use other web assembly runtimes, they should first make sure that Java binding provides an import function. In the case of wasmer, a popular runtime different from wasmtime, note that wasmer-java (https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-java)) does not provide the import function, so it cannot be used\nThe Maven setting file for SDK is as follows. It included wasmtime-java, commons-compress for reading wasm files directly from the OPA bundle, org.json for JSON parsing, and junit for unit tests, and the Java version was set to 1.8.\n\n  4.0.0\n  io.github.sangkeon\n  opa-wasm\n  0.1\n  \n    1.8\n    1.8\n  \n  \n    \n      io.github.kawamuray.wasmtime\n      wasmtime-java\n      0.4.0\n    \n    \n      org.apache.commons\n      commons-compress\n      1.20\n    \n    \n      org.json\n      json\n      20201115\n    \n    \n      junit\n      junit\n      4.13.2\n      test\n    \n  \n\nLet's initialize wasmtime and implement an env module and connect it to wasmtime. For related implementations, let's look at the constructor portion of the source code's OPAModule.java file.\npublic OPAModule(String filename) {\n  store = new Store();\n  engine = store.engine();\n  module = Module.fromFile(engine, filename);\n\n  linker = new Linker(store);\n\n  initImports();\n\n  wasi = new Wasi(store, new WasiConfig(new String[0], new PreopenDir[0]));\n  wasi.addToLinker(linker);\n  String modulename = \"policy\";\n\n  linker.module(modulename, module);\n\n  exports = OPAExports.getOPAExports(linker, modulename);\n\n  _baseHeapPtr = exports.opaHeapPtrGet();\n  _dataHeapPtr = _baseHeapPtr;\n  _dataAddr = loadJson(\"{}\");\n\n  loadBuiltins();\n}\nClasses such as Store, Moudle, Linker, Wasi, and Module are classes provided by Wasmtime. If you look at the code, first initialize the wasmtime store and engine, and then read the web assembly file (wasm extension) to initialize the module. The initImports function creates an object containing memory and functions and connects it to a linker, which will soon be described. Next, the WASI is initialized, a linker is added, and the module is connected to the linker. OPAExports.getOPAExports returns an instance of implementing the OPAExports interface so that it can take over linkers and module names and invoke functions exported by the OPA defined above. This part will also be examined in more detail soon. The next part is to initialize memory using the exported web assembly API and initialize data with empty objects with no content. This part is the same logic as other OPA web assemblies SDKs, such as npm-opa-wasm, except that the API exported to the web assembly is called from Java code. The last loadBuiltins() is a code that loads a list of built-in functions that can only be implemented in SDK because they are not implemented as web assemblies in OPA.\nThe initImports() section is as follows. There are many omitted parts, so please refer to the source code for the entire code.\nprivate void initImports() {\n  memory = new Memory(store, new MemoryType(new MemoryType.Limit(2)));\n\n  Extern opamemory = Extern.fromMemory(memory);\n\n  linker.define(OPAConstants.MODULE, OPAConstants.MEMORY, opamemory);\n\n  builtin2 = WasmFunctions.wrap(store, I32, I32, I32, I32, I32,\n    (builtinId, opaCtxReserved, addr1, addr2) -> {\n      return 0;\n    }\n  );\n\n  Extern opabuiltin2 = Extern.fromFunc(builtin2);\n\n  linker.define(OPAConstants.MODULE, OPAConstants.OPA_BUILTIN2, opabuiltin2);\n}\nThe content of the code creates a memory or function object, then creates an External object referring to the created object, and then defines the memory/function using the module name, memory/function name, and External object in the linker. MemoryType.Limit initially receives the number of memory pages to be initialized as a factor, and if OPA data or policies are complicated, you can specify a larger value at first. If more memory is needed, more memory is allocated internally through a grow call.\nThe first argument in WasmFunctions.wrap() is the store created when wasmtime was initialized, followed by the type arguments and the lambda function. If you look closely, you can see that the number of type arguments is one more than the number of arguments in the lambda function, and the last type is the type of function’s return value. Unless using built-in functions that cannot be implemented with a web assembly, the import functions of the env module have no problems without implementing them, and this SDK simply returned zero without implementing policies compiled from Java to the web assembly. \nThis time, let's look at the implementation of the OPAExports class. Looking at the contents, it is as follows, and only a part of the entire code was extracted because it had a similar pattern.\npublic class OPAExports implements OPAExportsAPI, Disposable {\n  private Linker linker;\n\n  private Func opaHeapPtrSetFn = null;\n  private Func opaJsonDumpFn = null;\n\n  private OPAExports(Linker linker, String moduleName) {\n    this.linker = linker;\n\n    initFns(moduleName);\n  }\n\n  public static OPAExportsAPI getOPAExports(Linker linker, String moduleName) {\n    return new OPAExports(linker, moduleName);\n  }\n\n  public void initFns(String moduleName) {\n    opaHeapPtrSetFn = linker.getOneByName(moduleName,  OPAConstants.OPA_HEAP_PTR_SET).func();\n    opaJsonDumpFn = linker.getOneByName(moduleName,  OPAConstants.OPA_JSON_DUMP).func();\n  }\n\n  public void disposeFns() {\n    if(opaHeapPtrSetFn != null) {\n      opaHeapPtrSetFn.dispose();\n      opaHeapPtrSetFn = null;\n    }\n\n    if(opaJsonDumpFn != null) {\n      opaJsonDumpFn.dispose();\n      opaJsonDumpFn = null;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public void dispose() {\n    disposeFns();\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void opaHeapPtrSet(OPAAddr addr) {\n    WasmFunctions.Consumer1 opa_heap_ptr_set = WasmFunctions.consumer(opaHeapPtrSetFn, I32);\n    opa_heap_ptr_set.accept(addr.getInternal());\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public OPAAddr opaJsonDump(OPAAddr valueAddr) {\n    WasmFunctions.Function1 opa_json_dump = WasmFunctions.func(opaJsonDumpFn, I32, I32);\n    int strAddr = opa_json_dump.call(valueAddr.getInternal());\n\n    return OPAAddr.newAddr(strAddr);\n  }\n}\nThe class constructor calls initFns and receives Func objects by calling linker's getOneByName() of functions exported by OPA. The Func class is defined in wasmtime-java to abstract the function. Since the function can be called several times, the Func object stores and reuses the reference in the class.\nThe functions with the @Override annotation are those declared in the Java interface defined earlier. In the implementation, the function is generated by forwarding the Func object and type to WasmFunctions.func() as an argument, and WasmFunctions.FunctionX is a function with X arguments and return values, and WasmFunctions.ConsumerX is a void type function. Since the function defined in the web assembly returns the int type, OPAAddr.newAddr() was called to convert it to the OPAAddr type containing the address. Referring to the entire source code, it can be seen that other functions are implemented in a similar pattern.\nFinally, the Func object should be released by calling dispose() at the end of use, and the OPAExports object implements the disposable interface of wasmtime-java to call dispose() for Func objects assigned by the creator in the dispose() function. Wasmtime-java's Disposible expands Java's Closable interface, allowing OPAExports objects to be used within the try block. When the OPAExports object is used, the assigned Func can be released by calling dispose().\nImplementation of SDK API\nLet's write an API for SDK using APIs exported by OPA. First, let's implement the function of converting memory values into strings by reading them from addresses returned to OPAAddr.\nprivate String dumpJson(OPAAddr addrResult) {\n  OPAAddr addr = exports.opaJsonDump(addrResult);\n  return decodeNullTerminatedString(memory, addr);\n}\nThe dumpJson() function receives the address values returned by the OPA export functions and calls exports.opaJsonDump(). The result of oppaJsonDump is also returned to the OPAAddr type. The codeNullTerminatedString (Memory, OPAAddr) for copying memory from that address was also implemented.\nprivate static String decodeNullTerminatedString(Memory memory, OPAAddr addr) {\n  int internalAddr = addr.getInternal();\n  int end = internalAddr;\n\n  ByteBuffer buf = memory.buffer();\n\n  while(buf.get(end) != 0) {\n    end++;\n  }\n\n  int size = end - internalAddr;\n\n  byte[] result = new byte[size];\n\n  for(int i = 0; i Memory is a class provided by wasmtime-java, and memory was allocated by the env module that was connected to the web assembly module as an import and connected to the linker. If you call getBuffer() for a memory object, you can get a Java ByteBuffer class back, and if you use the address returning from the OPA web assembly module as an offset for ByteBuffer, you can read the memory value. To read the string, we found the last location of the string and assigned the byte array to copy it by increasing the offset until we met the NULL character. Finally, the byte array was passed to the string generator to generate and return the string.\nOn the contrary, let's implement the part where SDK allocates memory and transfers the JSON string to the web assembly module. First, writing a code that writes a string to a Memory object is as follows.\nprivate OPAAddr writeString(Memory memory, String string) {\n  byte[] stringBytes = string.getBytes();\n\n  OPAAddr addr = exports.opaMalloc(stringBytes.length);\n\n  ByteBuffer buf = memory.buffer();\n\n  int internalAddr = addr.getInternal();\n\n  for(int i = 0; i First, the string is converted into a byte array, and the memory is allocated to OPAMalloc by the length of the byte array to receive a memory address. After that, you can receive ByteBuffer from the memory object and call Put() to ByteBuffer by the length of the byte array to the starting point of the address returned from OPAMalloc.\nA function to load JSON files into memory and parse them to check if they are loaded correctly is as follows.\npublic OPAAddr loadJson(String json) {\n  OPAAddr addr = writeString(memory, json);\n\n  OPAAddr parseAddr = exports.opaJsonParse(addr, json.length());\n\n  if (parseAddr.isNull()) {\n    throw new NullPointerException(\"Parsing failed\");\n  }\n\n  return parseAddr;\n}\nCall writeString() to write a string, receive an address, and call exports.opaJsonParse to parse whether it is a JSON format available in OPA. If parsing fails, the exception throws, and if there is no exception, the memory address returns.\nLet's take a look at the most complex function provided by the last SDK, the evaluate() function.\npublic String evaluate(String json) {\n  exports.opaHeapPtrSet(_dataHeapPtr);\n\n  OPAAddr inputAddr = loadJson(json);\n\n  OPAAddr ctxAddr = exports.opaEvalCtxNew();\n  exports.opaEvalCtxSetInput(ctxAddr, inputAddr);\n  exports.opaEvalCtxSetData(ctxAddr, _dataAddr);\n\n  exports.eval(ctxAddr);\n\n  OPAAddr resultAddr = exports.opaEvalCtxGetResult(ctxAddr);\n  return dumpJson(resultAddr);\n}\nPrior to the evaluation, the data heap pointer is initialized and the JSON to be used as an input is loaded. After that, the context for evaluation is created and input and data are set. Finally, the evaluation is performed, and the evaluation result is received as JSON and returned. Functions implemented inside the SDK differ only in how to bind to web assembly calls, and logic is almost the same.\nExample of using the OPA Web Assembly Java SDK\nSince we haven't updated the SDK to the Maven repository, let's go to the java-opa-wasm directory and run mvn install to install the SDK locally. At the end of the library installation, write the pom.xml to be used in the example program as follows.\n\n  4.0.0\n  io.github.sangkeon\n  opa-wasm-exam\n  0.1\n  \n    1.8\n    1.8\n  \n  \n    \n      io.github.sangkeon\n      opa-wasm\n      0.1\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        org.codehaus.mojo\n        exec-maven-plugin\n        1.6.0\n        \n          Main\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\nWe referred to the 0.1 version of the installed opa-wasm library, and added an exec plug-in to make it easier to execute examples with the mvn command.\nMoving the code used to describe the npm-opa-wasm SDK to Java is as follows. Let's save the following as src/main/main.java.\nimport io.github.sangkeon.opa.wasm.OPAModule;\n\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    try (\n      OPAModule om = new OPAModule(\"./sample-policy/wasm/policy.wasm\");\n    ) {\n      String input = \"{\\\"user\\\": \\\"john\\\"}\";\n      String data = \"{\\\"role\\\":{\\\"john\\\":\\\"admin\\\"}}\";\n\n      om.setData(data);\n\n      String output = om.evaluate(input);\n      System.out.println(\"Result=\" + output);\n    }\n  }\n}\nAfter saving the code, compile it with Maven, and run it, you can get the expected results as follows.\n$ mvn compile exec:java\n... \nResult=[{\"result\":true}]\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Total time: 1.097 s\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-03-08T18:17:14+09:00\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen implementing Java SDK, the function of loading policy.wasm and data.json embedded in bundle.tar.gz was implemented together. Please refer to the attached source for the corresponding code, and an example using a bundle is as follows.\nimport io.github.sangkeon.opa.wasm.Bundle;\nimport io.github.sangkeon.opa.wasm.BundleUtil;\nimport io.github.sangkeon.opa.wasm.OPAModule;\n\npublic class BundleMain {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    try {\n      Bundle bundle = BundleUtil.extractBundle(\"./sample-policy/bundle/bundle.tar.gz\");\n\n      try (\n        OPAModule om = new OPAModule(bundle);\n      ) {\n        String input = \"{\\\"user\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}\";\n        String output = om.evaluate(input);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Result=\" + output);\n      }\n    } catch(Exception e) {\n      e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n  }\n}\nSince the data is loaded from bundle.tar.gz, setData() is not called, but if you want to use new data without using bundle data, you can call setData(). To execute the code, only the main class of pom.xml needs to be changed to BundleMain and executed.\nOPA Web Assembly SDK and Built-in Functions\nCheck the Built-in Function to be Implemented in SDK\nSome built-in functions must be implemented by SDK, and the remaining built-in functions are written and provided by OPA into a web assembly. To determine which functions are provided and which functions should be implemented in the SDK, refer to the built-in function-related part of the OPA official document (https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#built-in-functions). As shown in Figure 11-1, the function written and provided by OPA as a web assembly has a green check mark on the Wasm Support item, and the function that SDK should implement is marked as SDK-defendant.\n \nFigure 11-1. Check whether the built-in function is supported for the Web Assembly\nInitialize the List of Built-in Functions to be called through SDK.\nLoadBuiltins() was called at the end of the constructor of the OPAModule class. The implementation related to this function is as follows.\nprivate Map builtinFunc = new HashMap<>();\n\npublic void loadBuiltins() {\n  builtinFunc.clear();\n\n  OPAAddr builtinaddr = exports.builtins();\n\n  if(!builtinaddr.isNull()) {\n    String jsonString = dumpJson(builtinaddr);\n\n    JSONObject jObject = new JSONObject(jsonString);\n\n    Iterator iter = jObject.keys();\n\n    while(iter.hasNext()) {\n      String key = iter.next();\n      int val = jObject.getInt(key);\n\n      builtinFunc.put(val, key);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\npublic String getFuncName(int id) {\n  return builtinFunc.get(id);\n}\nThis function calls the builtins() function exported by the OPA and is not provided by the OPA web assembly module, but receives a list of built-in functions (i.e., a list of built-in functions to be implemented in SDK) to JSON. Like any OPA export function, it returns the memory address, so you have to call dumpJson() to read the string. The returned JSON document is a key built-in function name and a value of 32-bit integer ID, such as {\"urlquery.encode\":0, \"http.send\":1} and so on. When a built-in function is called, it is called using this 32-bit integer ID, so it is stored in HashMap with the integer ID as the key and the function name as the value. When you call getFuncName(intid), the name of the function called in the code is returned, and null is returned when not found.\nExample of implementing a built-in function\nLet's implement the built-in function. Let's implement urlquery.encode, which is easy to implement among the functions that the SDK of the OPA official document should implement. The code implemented is as follows.\nbuiltin1 = WasmFunctions.wrap(store, I32, I32, I32, I32,\n  (builtinId, opaCtxReserved, addr1) -> {\n    String funcName = getFuncName(builtinId);\n\n    if(funcName == null) {\n      throw new UnsupportedException(\"builtin function builtinId=\" + builtinId + \" not supported\");\n    }\n\n    String arg1 = dumpJson(OPAAddr.newAddr(addr1));\n\n    switch (funcName) {\n      case \"urlquery.encode\":\n        String unquoted = arg1.substring(1, arg1.length() - 1);\n        String result = arg1.charAt(0) + java.net.URLEncoder.encode(unquoted)\n+ arg1.charAt(arg1.length()-1);\n        return loadJson(result).getInternal();\n      default:\n        break;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n  }\n);\nthe urlquery.encode receives a single string argument. Since the number of  arguments is one, it must be implemented inside the builtin1 export function. If the above-described getFuncName (builtinId) is called to receive the name of the function, and then matched by applying a switch statement to the name of the function, the logic is implemented. All  arguments passed to the address, and the string of the address can be read with dumpJson(). DumpJson is not only able to read JSON, but can also read expressions similar to the AstTerm format described in the implementation of the built-in function as a string. If an  argument is called in the form of a string, a string representation surrounded by quotes is passed. After removing the quotation mark, call java.net.URLEncoder.encode() to process the value, and add the quotation back and forth. The resulting string calls loadJson, reads it to memory, stores it, and returns the address.\nImplementation of a User-defined Built-in Function\nIt was confirmed that the functions indicated in the OPA official document that should be implemented in SDK can be implemented by implementing the builtinX export functions. Can the built-in functions defined by the user be called as well? What should I do to call? First, custom built-in functions must be compiled into binary by expanding the existing OPA with Go code, and then a wasm file must be created through that binary. Otherwise, it cannot be found when compiling from OPA to wasm, so it cannot be compiled. Once compiled, you can find a user-defined function in the list of builtins() API functions. When a built-in function is called, the built-in function is called, so if the function name matches inside the built-in function suitable for having X arguments, the function can be implemented and called in the same way as the built-in function.\nSummary\nChapter 11 deals with how to compile OPA policies using web assemblies and use them on various platforms. First, we explained how to use npm-opa-wasm, an OPA web assembly SDK for officially provided JavaScript. In addition, Java SDK was simply produced so that OPA web assemblies can be used in Java environments, which are widely used for the enterprises, and examples of using Java OPA policies were explained. Currently, the implementation of OPA's web assembly may not be considered perfect, but if time passes, it is expected that OPA can be used stably and well without a separate server in various development languages, and the possibility can be confirmed in Chapter 11.\n"}}}
